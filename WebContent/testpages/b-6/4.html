        <p> Leather is a durable and flexible material created by the tanning of  <a href="leaves/animalrawhideandskin.html">animal rawhide and skin,</a> often cattle hide. It can be produced through manufacturing processes ranging from cottage industry to heavy industry.
 </p>
        <p> Several  <a href="leaves/tanningprocessestransformhidesandskinsintoleather.html">tanning processes transform hides and skins into leather:</a> \n -  <a href="leaves/vegetabletannedleather.html">Vegetable-tanned leather</a> is tanned using tannins and other ingredients found in different vegetable matter, such as tree bark prepared in bark mills, wood, leaves, fruits and roots and other similar sources. It is supple and brown in color, with the exact shade depending on the mix of chemicals and the color of the skin. It is the only form of leather suitable for use in leather carving or stamping. Vegetable-tanned leather is not stable in water; it tends to discolor, so if left to soak and then dry it will shrink and become less supple, and harder. In hot water, it will shrink drastically and partly gelatinize, becoming rigid and eventually brittle. Boiled leather is an example of this, where the leather has been hardened by being immersed in hot water, or in boiled wax or similar substances. Historically, it was occasionally used as armor after hardening, and it has also been used for book binding. Vegetable tanned leathers present unique, recognizable and natural characteristics while respecting the environment, thanks to the heritage of expert craftsman and the use of old traditional recipes, new technologies and natural tannins. \n -  <a href="leaves/chrometannedleather.html">Chrome-tanned leather,</a> invented in 1858, is tanned using chromium sulfate and other salts of chromium. It is more supple and pliable than vegetable-tanned leather and does not discolor or lose shape as drastically in water as vegetable-tanned. It is also known as wet-blue for its color derived from the chromium.  <a href="leaves/moreesotericcolors.html">More esoteric colors</a> are possible using chrome tanning.
