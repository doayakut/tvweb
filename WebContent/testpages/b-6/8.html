        <p> Wool is the  <a href="leaves/textilefiberobtained.html">textile fiber obtained</a> from sheep and certain other animals, including cashmere from goats, mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from  <a href="leaves/camelids.html">camelids</a>. Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur: it is crimped, it is elastic, and it grows in staples (clusters). In the United States the term wool is usually restricted to describing the fibrous protein derived from the specialized skin cells called follicles in sheep, although in the UK it may be used of any  <a href="leaves/longcurlingfiber.html">long curling fiber</a> such as wood wool, wire wool, etc. Wool’s scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have a greater bulk than other textiles, and retain air, which causes the product to retain heat. Insulation works both ways: Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes to keep heat out and protect the body.
 </p>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/feltingofwool.html">Felting of wool</a> occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation because the microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibers hook together, somewhat like Velcro. The amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibers. Hair, by contrast, has little if any scale and no crimp, and little ability to bind into yarn. On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp.  <a href="leaves/differenttypesoffinewool.html">Different types of Fine Wool</a>. The relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to breed, and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning, felting, or carding into batts for quilts or other insulating products, including the famous  <a href="leaves/tweedclothofscotland.html">tweed cloth of Scotland</a>. Wool fibers are hydrophilic, meaning they readily absorb moisture, but are not hollow. Wool can absorb moisture almost one-third of its own weight. Wool absorbs sound like many other fabrics. It is generally a creamy white color, although some breeds of sheep produce natural colors, such as black, brown, silver, and random mixes.
