    <h3><a href="0.html">Fleece
</a></h3>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/polarfleece.html">Polar fleece</a> usually referred to simply as "fleece," is a soft napped insulating synthetic fabric made from Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or other synthetic fibers. Other names for this fabric are " <a href="leaves/polarwool.html">Polar Wool",</a> "Vega Wool" or "Velo Wool", however the names of the composition suggests organic materials being used, fleece is 100% Polyethylene Terephthalate. One of the first forms was Polar Fleece created in 1979 by Malden Mills, now Polartec LLC., a new, light and strong pile fabric meant to mimic and in some ways surpass wool. Fleece has some of wool’s finest qualities but weighs a fraction of the lightest available woollens. Polar fleece is used in jackets, hats, sweaters, jogging bottoms/sweatpants, gym clothes, hoodies, inexpensive throw blankets, and high-performance outdoor clothing, and can be used as a vegan alternative to wool. It can be made partially from recycled plastic bottles and is very light, soft and easy to wash. Aaron Feuerstein intentionally declined to patent Polar fleece, allowing the material to be produced cheaply and widely by many vendors, leading to the material’s quick and wide acceptance.

        <p> Fleece is a very soft, lightweight, warm and comfortable fabric.  <a href="leaves/fleecegarmentstraditionallycomeindifferentthickness.html">Fleece garments traditionally come in different thickness</a>. It is hydrophobic, holding less than 1% of its weight in water, it retains much of its insulating powers even when wet, and it is highly breathable. These qualities make it useful for making clothing intended to be used during strenuous physical activity; perspiration is able to readily pass through the fabric. It is machine washable and dries quickly. It is a good alternative to wool (of particular importance to those who are allergic or sensitive to wool). It can also be made out of recycled PET bottles, or even  <a href="leaves/recycledfleece.html">recycled fleece</a>. There are disadvantages to this fabric as well.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Denim is a rugged  <a href="leaves/cottontwilltextile.html">cotton twill textile,</a> in which the weft passes under two (twi- "double") or more warp threads. This twill weaving produces the familiar diagonal ribbing of the fabric, which distinguishes denim from cotton duck. It is characteristic of any indigo denim that only the warp threads are dyed, whereas the weft threads remain plain white. As a result of the warp-faced twill weaving, one side of the fabric shows the blue warp threads, the other side shows the white weft threads. This is why jeans are white on the inside and what makes  <a href="leaves/denimsfadingcharacteristics.html">denim’s fading characteristics</a> unique compared to every other fabric.  <a href="leaves/drydenim.html">Dry denim,</a> as opposed to washed denim, is a denim fabric that is not washed after being dyed during its production. Over time, denim will generally fade, which is often considered desirable. During the process of wear, it is typical to see fading on areas that generally receive the most stress, which includes the upper thighs (whiskers),  <a href="leaves/theanklesstacks.html">the ankles (stacks)</a> and behind the knees (honey combs).
 </p>
        <p> After being crafted into an article of clothing, most denim is washed to make it softer and to reduce or eliminate shrinkage, which could cause an item to not fit after the owner washes it. In addition to being washed, non-dry denim is sometimes artificially "distressed" to produce a worn look. Much of the appeal of factory distressed denim is that it looks similar to dry denim that has, with time, faded. With dry denim, however, such fading is affected by the body of the person who wears the jeans and the activities of his/her daily life. This creates what many enthusiasts feel to be a more natural, unique look than distressed denim. To facilitate the natural distressing process, some wearers of dry denim will often abstain from washing their jeans for more than six months, though it is not a necessity for fading. "Selvage denim" refers to a unique type of closed selvage (derived from the  <a href="leaves/latinsalvare.html">Latin Salvare,</a> meaning "to secure, to make safe") that is created using one continuous cross yarn (the weft) that is passed back and forth through the vertical warp beams.

<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Lace is an  <a href="leaves/openworkfabric.html">openwork fabric,</a> patterned with open holes in the work, made by machine or by hand. The holes can be formed via removal of threads or cloth from a previously woven fabric, but more often open spaces are created as part of the lace fabric. Lace-making is an ancient craft. True lace was not made until the late 15th and early 16th centuries.  <a href="leaves/atruelace.html">A true lace</a> is created when a thread is looped, twisted or braided to other threads independently from a backing fabric. Originally linen, silk, gold, or silver threads were used. Now lace is often made with cotton thread, although linen and silk threads are still available. Manufactured lace may be made of synthetic fiber. A few modern artists make lace with a fine copper or silver wire instead of thread.
 </p>
        <p> In the  <a href="leaves/late16thcentury.html">late 16th century</a> there was a rapid development in the field of lace. There was an openwork fabric where combinations of open spaces and dense textures form designs. These forms of lace were dominant in both fashion as well as home décor during the late 1500s. For enhancing the beauty of collars and cuffs, needle lace was embroidered with loops and picots.  <a href="leaves/highfashionjllacemanufacturer.html">High Fashion JL lace Manufacturer</a>.  <a href="leaves/objectsresemblinglacebobbins.html">Objects resembling lace bobbins</a> have been found in Roman remains, but there are no records of Roman lace-making.

    <h3><a href="3.html">Khaki
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Khaki is a color, a light shade of yellow-brown similar to tan or beige.  It has been used by many armies around the world for uniforms, including camouflage. It has been used as a color name in English since 1848.  <a href="leaves/armedserviceannouncescancellationofkhakiasservicedress.html">Armed Service announces cancellation of Khaki as service dress</a>. In Western fashion, it is a standard color for smart casual dress trousers for civilians. However, the name is sometimes also used to describe a drab green color. In the mid-twentieth century as many Western militaries adopted an olive drab instead of the older, more brownish khaki, the two color names became associated with each other. In French, and German, for example, "khaki" refers to a much darker olive drab-style military green. In 1846 Sir Harry Lumsden raised a Corps of Guides for frontier service from British Indian recruits at Peshawar.  <a href="leaves/lumsden.html">Lumsden</a> was of the view that the border troops were best dressed in their native costume, which consisted of a smock and white pajama trousers made of a coarse home-spun cotton, and a cotton turban, supplemented by a leather or padded cotton jacket for cold weather. For the first year, no attempt was made at uniformity. Subsequently, the material was dyed locally with a dye prepared from the native mazari palm. This created a drab gray which was used historically by Afghan tribals for camouflaging themselves. However, mazari could not dye leather jackets, and an alternative was sought. Cloth was dyed in mulberry juice which gave a yellowish drab shade. Subsequently all regiments, whether British or Indian, serving in the region had adopted properly dyed khaki uniforms for active service and summer dress.  <a href="leaves/theoriginalkhaki.html">The original khaki</a> fabric was a closely twilled cloth of linen or cotton.

        <p> During  <a href="leaves/thesecondboerwar.html">the Second Boer War,</a> the British forces became known as Khakis because of their uniforms.

        <p> Leather is a durable and flexible material created by the tanning of  <a href="leaves/animalrawhideandskin.html">animal rawhide and skin,</a> often cattle hide. It can be produced through manufacturing processes ranging from cottage industry to heavy industry.
 </p>
        <p> Several  <a href="leaves/tanningprocessestransformhidesandskinsintoleather.html">tanning processes transform hides and skins into leather:</a> \n -  <a href="leaves/vegetabletannedleather.html">Vegetable-tanned leather</a> is tanned using tannins and other ingredients found in different vegetable matter, such as tree bark prepared in bark mills, wood, leaves, fruits and roots and other similar sources. It is supple and brown in color, with the exact shade depending on the mix of chemicals and the color of the skin. It is the only form of leather suitable for use in leather carving or stamping. Vegetable-tanned leather is not stable in water; it tends to discolor, so if left to soak and then dry it will shrink and become less supple, and harder. In hot water, it will shrink drastically and partly gelatinize, becoming rigid and eventually brittle. Boiled leather is an example of this, where the leather has been hardened by being immersed in hot water, or in boiled wax or similar substances. Historically, it was occasionally used as armor after hardening, and it has also been used for book binding. Vegetable tanned leathers present unique, recognizable and natural characteristics while respecting the environment, thanks to the heritage of expert craftsman and the use of old traditional recipes, new technologies and natural tannins. \n -  <a href="leaves/chrometannedleather.html">Chrome-tanned leather,</a> invented in 1858, is tanned using chromium sulfate and other salts of chromium. It is more supple and pliable than vegetable-tanned leather and does not discolor or lose shape as drastically in water as vegetable-tanned. It is also known as wet-blue for its color derived from the chromium.  <a href="leaves/moreesotericcolors.html">More esoteric colors</a> are possible using chrome tanning.

        <p> Chiffon is a lightweight, balanced plain-woven sheer fabric woven of alternate S- and Z-twist crepe (high-twist) yarns.The twist in the crepe yarns puckers the fabric slightly in both directions after weaving, giving it some stretch and a slightly rough feel. Chiffon is made from cotton, silk or synthetic fibres. Chiffon can be dyed to almost any shade, but chiffon made from polyester can be difficult to dye.

<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Velvet is a type of  <a href="leaves/woventuftedfabric.html">woven tufted fabric</a> in which the cut threads are evenly distributed, with a short dense pile, giving it a distinctive feel.The word ‘velvety’ is used as an adjective to mean "smooth like velvet." Velvet can be either synthetic or natural.Velvet is woven on a special loom that weaves two thicknesses of velvet at the same time. The two pieces are then cut apart to create the pile effect, and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls. Velvet was expensive to make before industrial power looms became available. Velvet is  <a href="leaves/difficulttoclean.html">difficult to clean</a> because of its pile, but modern dry cleaning methods make cleaning more feasible.  <a href="leaves/velvetpile.html">Velvet pile</a> is created by warp or vertical yarns and velveteen pile is created by weft or fill yarns.
 </p>
        <p> Velvet can be made from many different kinds of fibers, traditionally silk. Velvet made entirely from silk has market prices of several hundred US dollars per yard. Cotton can also be used, though this often results in a slightly less luxurious fabric. Velvet can also be made from fibers such as linen, mohair, and wool. A cloth made by the Kuba people of the Democratic Republic of Congo from raffia is often referred to as "Kuba velvet". More recently, synthetic velvets have been developed, mostly polyester, nylon, viscose, acetate, and mixtures of different synthetics, or synthetics and natural fibers (for example viscose mixed with silk). A small percentage of spandex is sometimes added to give stretch. raditionally, velvet is associated with nobility. Velvet was  <a href="leaves/introducedtobaghdad.html">introduced to Baghdad</a> during the rule of Harun al-Rashid by Kashmiri merchants and to Al-Andalus by Ziryab. In the Mamluk era, Cairo was the world’s largest producer of velvet.

Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur: it is crimped, it is elastic, and it grows in staples (clusters). In the United States the term wool is usually restricted to describing the fibrous protein derived from the specialized skin cells called follicles in sheep, although in the UK it may be used of any  <a href="leaves/longcurlingfiber.html">long curling fiber</a> such as wood wool, wire wool, etc. Wool’s scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have a greater bulk than other textiles, and retain air, which causes the product to retain heat. Insulation works both ways: Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes to keep heat out and protect the body.
 </p>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/feltingofwool.html">Felting of wool</a> occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation because the microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibers hook together, somewhat like Velcro. The amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibers. Hair, by contrast, has little if any scale and no crimp, and little ability to bind into yarn. On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp.  <a href="leaves/differenttypesoffinewool.html">Different types of Fine Wool</a>.

Wool fibers are hydrophilic, meaning they readily absorb moisture, but are not hollow. Wool can absorb moisture almost one-third of its own weight. Wool absorbs sound like many other fabrics.

        <p> Brocade is a class of richly decorative  <a href="leaves/shuttlewovenfabricsoften.html">shuttle-woven fabrics, often</a> made in colored silks and with or without gold and silver threads. The name, related to the same root as the word "broccoli," comes from Italian broccato meaning "embossed cloth," originally past participle of the verb broccare "to stud, set with nails," from brocco, "small nail," from Latin broccus, "projecting, pointed." Brocade is typically woven on a  <a href="leaves/drawloom.html">draw loom</a>. It is a supplementary weft technique, that is, the ornamental brocading is produced by a supplementary, non-structural, weft in addition to the standard weft that holds the warp threads together. The purpose of this is to give the appearance that the weave actually was embroidered on. In Guatemala, brocade is the most popular technique used to decorate fabric  <a href="leaves/wovenbymaya.html">woven by Maya</a> weavers on backstrap looms.
 </p>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/ornamentalfeaturesinbrocade.html">Ornamental features in brocade</a> are emphasized and wrought as additions to the main fabric, sometimes stiffening it, though more frequently producing on its face the effect of low relief.

When the weft is floating on the back, this is known as a continuous brocade; the supplementary weft runs from selvage to selvage. The yarns are cut away in cutwork and broché. Also, a discontinuous brocade is where the supplementary yarn is only woven in the patterned areas. Dating back to the Middle Ages, brocade fabric was one of the few luxury fabrics worn by nobility throughout China, Greece, Japan, Korea and Byzantium. Woven by the Byzantines, brocades were an especially desirable fabric. From the 4th to the 6th centuries, production of silk was seemingly non-existent, as linen and wool were the predominant fabrics. During this period, there was no public knowledge of silk fabric production except for that which was kept secret by the Chinese.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective capsule, around the seeds of cotton plants of the genus Gossypium. The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will tend to increase the dispersion of the seeds. The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds. The English name derives from the Arabic (al) qutn قُطْن, which began to be used circa 1400 AD.The Spanish word, "algodón", is likewise derived from the Arabic. The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and the  <a href="leaves/indusvalleycivilization.html">Indus Valley Civilization</a> (modern day Pakistan and some parts of India). Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that so lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.
 </p>
        <p> Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world’s arable land. China is the world’s largest  <a href="leaves/producerofcotton.html">producer of cotton,</a> but most of this is used domestically. The United States has been the largest exporter for many years.

        <p> Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective capsule, around the seeds of cotton plants of the genus Gossypium. The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will tend to increase the dispersion of the seeds. The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds. The English name derives from the Arabic (al) qutn قُطْن, which began to be used circa 1400 AD.The Spanish word, "algodón", is likewise derived from the Arabic. The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and the Indus Valley Civilization (modern day Pakistan and some parts of India). Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that so lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.
 </p>
        <p> Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world’s arable land. China is the world’s largest producer of cotton, but most of this is used domestically. The United States has been the largest exporter for many years. Cotton was used in the Old World at least 7,000 years ago (5th millennium BC). Evidence of cotton use has been found at the site of Mehrgarh, where early cotton threads have been preserved in copper bads.Cotton cultivation became more widespread during the Indus Valley Civilization, which covered parts of modern eastern Pakistan and northwestern India.The Indus cotton industry was well developed and some methods used in cotton spinning and fabrication continued to be used until the industrialization of India.

        <p> Rayon is a manufactured  <a href="leaves/regeneratedcellulosefiber.html">regenerated cellulose fiber</a>.

It is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments which are chemically solidified, resulting in fibers of nearly pure cellulose.Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers, it is considered a semi-synthetic fiber.Specific types of rayon include viscose, modal and lyocell, each of which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product. Some  <a href="leaves/majorrayonfiberuses.html">major rayon fiber uses</a> include apparel (e.g. Aloha shirts, blouses, dresses, jackets, lingerie, linings, scarves, suits, neckties, hats, socks), the filling in  <a href="leaves/zippolighters.html">Zippo lighters,</a> furnishings (e.g. bedspreads, bedsheets, blankets, window treatments, upholstery, slipcovers), industrial uses (e.g. medical surgery products, non-woven products, tire cord), and other uses (e.g. yarn, feminine hygiene products, diapers, towels). Rayon is a major feedstock in the production of carbon fiber.

        <p> Finally, in 1894, English chemist Charles Frederick Cross, and his collaborators  <a href="leaves/edwardjohnbevan.html">Edward John Bevan,</a> and Clayton Beadle patented their artificial silk, which they named "viscose", because the reaction product of carbon disulfide and cellulose in basic conditions gave a highly viscous solution of xanthate. The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the UK company Courtaulds Fibers in 1905. Avtex Fibers Incorporated began selling their formulation in the United States in 1910. The name "rayon" was adopted in 1924, with "viscose" being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane. In Europe, though, the fabric itself became known as "viscose," which has been ruled an acceptable alternative term for rayon by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

        <p> Silk is a  <a href="leaves/naturalproteinfibre.html">natural protein fibre,</a> some forms of which can be woven into textiles. The protein fibre of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. The best-known type of silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture).  <a href="leaves/theshimmeringappearanceof.html">The shimmering appearance of</a> silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors. Silks are produced by several other insects, but generally only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing. There has been some research into other silks, which differ at the molecular level. Many silks are mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some adult insects such as webspinners produce silk, and some insects such as raspy crickets produce silk throughout their lives.  <a href="leaves/silkproduction.html">Silk production</a> also occurs in Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies and midges. Other types of arthropod d produce silk, most notably various arachnids such as spiders (see spider silk).

However, the scale of production was always far smaller than that of cultivated silks. There are several reasons for this: firstly, they differ from the domesticated varieties in colour and texture and are therefore less uniform; secondly, cocoons gathered in the wild have usually had the pupa emerge from them before being discovered so the silk thread that makes up the cocoon has been torn into shorter lengths; and thirdly, many wild cocoons are covered in a mineral layer that stymies attempts to reel from them long strands of silk.

Flannel was originally made from carded wool or worsted yarn, but is now often made from either wool, cotton, or synthetic fibre. Flannel may be brushed to create extra softness or remain unbrushed. The brushing process is a mechanical process where a fine metal brush rubs the fabric to create fine fibers from the loosely spun yarns. Typically, flannel has either a single- or double-sided nap.  <a href="leaves/doublenappedflannel.html">Double-napped flannel</a> refers to a fabric that has been brushed on both sides. If the flannel is not napped, it gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn in its woven form.

    <h3><a href="15.html">Bamboo textiles

        <p> Bamboo textiles are cloth, yarn, and clothing made out of bamboo fibres. While  <a href="leaves/historicallyusedonlyforstructuralelements.html">historically used only for structural elements,</a> such as bustles and the ribs of corsets, in recent years a range of technologies have been developed allowing bamboo fibre to be used in a wide range of textile and fashion applications. Modern bamboo clothing is clothing made from either 100% bamboo yarn or a blend of bamboo and cotton yarn. The bamboo yarn can also be blended with other textile fibres such as hemp or even spandex.  In China and Japan,  <a href="leaves/thinstripsofbamboo.html">thin strips of bamboo</a> were woven together into hats and shoes. One particular design of bamboo hats was associated with rural life, being worn almost universally by farmers and fishermen in order to protect their heads from the sun.In the West, bamboo, alongside other components such as whalebone and steel wire, was sometimes used as a structural component in corsets, bustles and other types of structural elements used in fashionable women’s dresses.
 </p>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/bamboofibre.html">Bamboo fibre</a> is a cellulose fibre extracted or fabricated from natural bamboo (and possibly other additives) and is made from (or in the case of material fabrication, is) the pulp of bamboo plants. It is usually not made from the fibres of the plant, but is a synthetic viscose made from bamboo cellulose. Bamboo has gained popularity as a  <a href="leaves/greenfibre.html">"green" fibre</a>.Manufacturers tout the fact that bamboo can be cultivated quickly, can be used as a cash crop to develop impoverished regions of the third world, and is a natural fibre (as opposed to popular synthetics like polyester) whose cultivation results in a decrease in greenhouse gases.There may be environmental problems with the cultivation of land expressly for bamboo and the use of harsh chemicals to turn bamboo into usable fibre for clothing.Bamboo is  <a href="leaves/extremelyresilient.html">extremely resilient</a> and durable as a fiber. In studies comparing it to cotton and polyester, it is found to have a high breaking tenacity, better moisture wicking properties, and better moisture absorption.
