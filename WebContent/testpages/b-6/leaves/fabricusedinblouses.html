    <h3><a href="fabricusedinblouses.html">fabric used in blouses</a></h3>
        <p>  It is also a popular  fabric used in blouses, ribbons, scarves and lingerie. Like other  crepe fabrics, chiffon can be difficult to work with because of its light and slippery texture. Due to this  delicate nature, chiffon must be hand washed very gently. Since chiffon is a light-weight fabric that frays very easily, bound or French seams must be used to stop the fabric from fraying </p>
