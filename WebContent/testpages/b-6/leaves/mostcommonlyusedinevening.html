        <p> Chiffon is  most commonly used in evening wear, especially as an overlay, for giving an elegant and floating appearance to the gown. It is also a popular  fabric used in blouses, ribbons, scarves and lingerie. Like other  crepe fabrics, chiffon can be difficult to work with because of its light and slippery texture. Due to this  delicate nature, chiffon must be hand washed very gently </p>
