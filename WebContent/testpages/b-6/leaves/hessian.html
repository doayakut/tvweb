        <p> Burlap or  Hessian, a dense woven fabric, has been historically produced as a coarse fabric, but more recently it is being used in a refined state known simply as jute as an eco-friendly material for bags, rugs, and other products. The name "burlap" appears to be of unknown origin.The name "hessian" is attributed to the use of the fabric, initially, as part of the uniform of soldiers from the German state of Hessewho were called "Hessians".  It is breathable and thus resists condensation and associated spoilage of the contents </p>
