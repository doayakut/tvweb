    <h3><a href="latinsalvare.html">Latin Salvare</a></h3>
        <p> "Selvage denim" refers to a unique type of closed selvage (derived from the  Latin Salvare, meaning "to secure, to make safe") that is created using one continuous cross yarn (the weft) that is passed back and forth through the vertical warp beams. This is traditionally finished at both edge with a contrast warp, most commonly red which is why sometimes this type of denim is referred to as "Red Selvage". This process is only possible using a Shuttle loom. Shuttle looms weave a narrower 30 inch fabric, which is on average half the width of the more modern shuttleless Sulzer looms (invented in 1927 by the Sulzer brothers) and thus a longer piece of fabric is required to make a pair of jeans (approximately 3 yards) </p>
