    <h3><a href="longcurlingfiber.html">long curling fiber</a></h3>
        <p>  In the United States the term wool is usually restricted to describing the fibrous protein derived from the specialized skin cells called follicles in sheep, although in the UK it may be used of any  long curling fiber such as wood wool, wire wool, etc. Woolâ€™s scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have a greater bulk than other textiles, and retain air, which causes the product to retain heat. Insulation works both ways: Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes to keep heat out and protect the body </p>
