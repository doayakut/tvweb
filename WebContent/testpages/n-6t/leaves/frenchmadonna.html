    <h3><a href="frenchmadonna.html">French Madonna</a></h3>
        <p>  One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a  French Madonna with angels from around 1410 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. However,  panel painting remained more common until the 16th century in Italy and the 17th century in Northern Europe. Mantegna and Venetian artists were among those leading the change; Venetian sail canvas was readily available and regarded as the best quality.
