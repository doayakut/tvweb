        <p> Wool is the  textile fiber obtained from sheep and certain other animals, including cashmere from goats, mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from  camelids. Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur: it is crimped, it is elastic, and it grows in staples (clusters). In the United States the term wool is usually restricted to describing the fibrous protein derived from the specialized skin cells called follicles in sheep, although in the UK it may be used of any  long curling fiber such as wood wool, wire wool, etc. Woolâ€™s scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together </p>
