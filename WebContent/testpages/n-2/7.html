 </p>
        <p> The first chain-driven model was developed around 1885. 
 </p>
        <p> Before 1868, and in some places thereafter, bikes were known primarily as velocipedes. 
 </p>
        <p> The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan, a 
 </p>
        <p> Scottish blacksmith, in 1839. 
 </p>
        <p> He is associated with the first recorded instance of a cycling traffic offense when he knocked over a little 
 </p>
        <p> girl in Glasgow and was fined five shillings.
