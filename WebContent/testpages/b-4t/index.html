    <h3><a href="0.html">Catfish
</a></h3>
        <p> Farming  <a href="leaves/catfish.html">catfish</a> is truly a U.S. seafood industry success story. It started in Arkansas in the 1960s and expanded into an economic powerhouse as Southern soybean and rice farmers built ponds and processing facilities. Most  <a href="leaves/catfishfarms.html">catfish farms</a> today are located in the Mississippi Delta, with additional production in Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana. A typical pond is 16 acres and produces 4,000 to 7,000 pounds of catfish per acre. The channel cat is possibly the fastest-growing catfish species in the world. And it’s one of the best protein converters: 1 pound of catfish for every 2 pounds of feed (compared to 7:1 for beef and 4:1 for pork). At market size (1 to 1 1/2 pounds), catfish are harvested and then transported live in tank trucks from the farms to processing plants, where they are processed immediately. Catfish is one of the most quality-controlled products in the food industry, and its farming is regulated by the  <a href="leaves/foodanddrugadministration.html">Food and Drug Administration</a>.
 </p>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/peopletellingcatfishstories.html">People telling Catfish Stories</a>. Uncooked catfish smells almost like raw chicken. Because it’s a grain-fed, farmed fish, catfish has a consistently sweet, mild taste. It absorbs other flavors readily. The moist, dense meat is firm and has less flake than the typical whitefish. Fresh catfish meat is white to off-white, sometimes pinkish, with noticeable translucency and iridescence. Cooked meat is opaque and white. Don’t buy it if it is reddish or slightly yellow. Also, don’t expect it to have the oceany odor of marine fish. Quality can fluctuate with water conditions and feed sources. Watch out for “specials” that might feature wild,  <a href="leaves/rivercaughtcatfish.html">river-caught catfish</a>. And don’t mistake ocean catfish, or wolffish, for farmed channel catfish.

    <h3><a href="1.html">Lingcod
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> If ever there were a fish with an identity crisis, it’s the lingcod, for despite its name, this species is neither a cod nor a ling. Rather, it’s a Pacific greenling, from the family Hexagrammidae.  <a href="leaves/recordlingcodcaught.html">Record Lingcod Caught</a>. The lingcod likely got the name ling from early settlers who related it to European lings but acknowledged its white flaky flesh by adding cod.  <a href="leaves/cultuscod.html">Cultus cod</a> was the name used most often in the early 1900s — an insult to this fine fish, as cultus means “of little worth” in Chinook. Lingcod ranges from Baja California to Kodiak Island and the Aleutian Peninsula. It is a bycatch of trawl and longline fisheries, though there is a targeted fishery in Southeast Alaska. The best lingcod is landed by hook-and-line boats that bleed and ice the fish immediately after harvest. Lingcod can grow to 90 pounds but typical market size is around 10 pounds. Don’t be alarmed by the blue-green tint of the raw meat. The color cooks out completely, leaving a snow-white piece of fish.  <a href="leaves/themildtastingmeatoflingcod.html">The mild-tasting meat of Lingcod</a> is tender yet firm, with large, soft, moist flakes.

        <p> A favorite in the Pacific Northwest for upscale fish and chips,  <a href="leaves/lingcodcanbepreparedmanyways.html">lingcod can be prepared many ways</a>. It works well on the grill, and large lingcod can be stuffed with vegetables and baked. Steaks and fillets are good baked with a topping such as a sun-dried tomato sauce. Steaks also may be steamed with herbs and spices. The density of the flesh requires a longer cooking time than that of other whitefish, but be careful not to overcook the lean meat.  <a href="leaves/cheaplingcod.html">Cheap lingcod</a> usually means trawl-caught fish, inferior to hook-and-line lingcod. But if you know a quality-conscious skipper who makes short trips, you can get a good buy on trawled product.
 </p>
    
    <h3><a href="2.html">Turbot
</a></h3>
        <p> Found on menus in the whitest of white-tablecloth restaurants, turbot (pronounced tur-bet) is a favored flatfish for discerning chefs. A member of the Bothidae, or left-eyed, family of flounders, turbot (previously known as Psetta maxima) is found in shallow inshore waters throughout the Mediterranean and north to the Norwegian Sea.  <a href="leaves/primaryproducers.html">Primary producers</a> are the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Global supplies are limited, which accounts for the high price this fish commands. Farmed production in France, Spain and Chile is supplementing wild harvests.  <a href="leaves/farmraisedturbot.html">Farm-raised turbot</a> are generally smaller (1 to 4 pounds) and milder in flavor than wild turbot, which can reach 30 pounds but average 10 pounds. Several lesser-quality species of flatfish are sometimes passed off as European turbot, including  <a href="leaves/greenlandturbot.html">Greenland turbot</a> and some West Coast flounders. Inferior in flavor and with softer flesh, these flatfish can’t compare to the real turbot.
 </p>
        <p> Turbot has  <a href="leaves/gleamingflesh.html">gleaming flesh</a> that retains its bright-white appearance when cooked. The firm meat has a large flake and an excellent mild flavor. Like all flatfish, a turbot yields four  <a href="leaves/fillets.html">fillets,</a> with meatier back fillets than belly portions. Fillets from a 3- to 4-pound turbot are quite meaty; those from smaller fish can be rather thin. A rim of fatty tissue on the fin side of each fillet contains a row of “kernels” of snow-white meat. Treat turbot with the respect it deserves, using preparations that highlight the delicate flavor and bright-white flesh. Turbot is good baked whole; the bones add flavor. Fillets can be overcooked in dry heat; steaming, poaching and pan-frying are preferable to grilling.
 </p>
    
    <h3><a href="3.html">Bream
</a></h3>
        <p> This high-valued species is the favored  <a href="leaves/seabream.html">sea bream,</a> prized in Mediterranean cuisine and highly regarded by European chefs. It gets the “gilt-head” name from the golden stripe between its eyes. The Romans reportedly called the bream “Aurata,” the gilded one. The Greek goddess Aphrodite also considered the gilt-head bream sacred. The fish reach maturity during their second year, up to which time they are male. In the third year, for reasons not fully understood, they become female. Sea bream are found in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, but commercial harvests are small. As with European sea bass, bream is increasingly supplied by aquaculture operations, mostly in the Mediterranean. Some is also raised in Iceland in geothermic water. A small member of the  <a href="leaves/porgyfamily.html">porgy family,</a> Sparidae, sea bream usually run 10 to 14 inches long and between 1 1/4 and 6 pounds. Upscale chefs in the United States menu  <a href="leaves/breambyitsfrenchname.html">bream by its French name,</a> daurade, or daurade royale.
 </p>
        <p> The  <a href="leaves/rosycoloredraw.html">rosy-colored raw</a> meat turns white when cooked. Bream’s moist flesh has a rich, sweet flavor. The texture is firm but tender. Daurade is best cooked whole, dressed but with the backbone left in. Because the flesh holds together well, it can be braised and used in stews. It is the fish traditionally featured in bouillabaisse. The fish is excellent poached in wine. It can also be stuffed and baked, grilled or sautéed. A lesser bream, Pagellus bogaraveo, or red bream, is known by  <a href="leaves/thefrenchname.html">the French name</a> dorade communue; don’t confuse it with the superior daurade royale, Sparus auratus.
 </p>
    
    <h3><a href="4.html">Pompano
</a></h3>
        <p> Gourmands describe the  <a href="leaves/atlanticpompano.html">Atlantic pompano</a> as “the world’s most edible fish.” The flat-bodied, pan-sized pompano is easy to eat whole, a form that shows off the beautiful, silvery skin. The species is harvested from Virginia to Texas, but primarily off Florida’s west coast. Commercial landings are limited, and as a result, prices remain high in most markets. This makes the pompano a tempting target for substitution — and an easy one, since there are several different species of pompano within the confusing Carangidae, or jack, family. The star of the clan, the Atlantic pompano, is often confused with  <a href="leaves/threelessdelectablerelatives.html">three less delectable relatives:</a> the similar-looking permit, the palometa and the gafftopsail pompano. But it’s not that difficult to tell the real McCoy: Any fish bigger than 3 pounds can be eliminated, since  <a href="leaves/marketsizedpompano.html">market-sized pompano</a> average 2 pounds.
 </p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Though technically a round fish, the  <a href="leaves/narrowbodiedpompano.html">narrow-bodied pompano</a> is structured much like a flatfish and generally weighs less than 3 pounds. The attractive, silvery skin is edible and does not require scaling.  <a href="leaves/pompanomeat.html">Pompano meat</a> is firm but finely flaked, with a sweet, mild flavor. The flesh is pearly white, with a moderate fat content, and cooks up white. Pompano lends itself to whole preparations since it is easy to eat off the bone. It can also be halved lengthwise to produce two long fillets. When serving, try to display the attractive skin. The simplest way to prepare pompano is to broil it with lemon and butter. Perhaps the most famous preparation for this fish is en papillote (cooked in parchment).

</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p>  <a href="leaves/bluefisharevoraciousfeeders.html">Bluefish are voracious feeders</a> and fierce fighters, earning them the name “chopper” among fishermen. Blues can weigh up to 30 pounds; fish bigger than 10 pounds are called “horses,” while youngsters of 1 to 2 pounds are known as “snappers.” Average market size is 3 to 5 pounds. Bluefish travel up and down the eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida, following schools of small, oil-rich menhaden, a favored food. This diet of pogies gives older blues their pronounced flavor.  <a href="leaves/youngerbluefish.html">Younger bluefish</a> eat crustaceans, resulting in a sweeter and milder flesh. Main bluefish producers are the Chesapeake Bay area, New Jersey and Long Island, and North Carolina has a significant winter fishery.  <a href="leaves/bluefishdeterioratesrapidly.html">Bluefish deteriorates rapidly</a> if not immediately iced, and it doesn’t freeze well. That’s why the fish is seldom seen far from where it’s landed unless flown in by a restaurant as a special. So buy in season and handle with care.
 </p>
        <p> The meat of  <a href="leaves/uncookedbluefish.html">uncooked bluefish</a> ranges from a light putty color to blue-gray with a brownish tinge. It becomes lighter when cooked. A strong-flavored, dark strip of meat on the fillet may be removed before cooking. Bluefish has a rich, full flavor and coarse, moist meat with edible skin. The larger the fish, the more pronounced the taste. Plan to cook bluefish within a day of purchase. True fish lovers appreciate the rich, strong flavor of blues, which can be nicely complemented by acidic ingredients like lime and lemon juice or tomato. For  <a href="leaves/aneasyentre.html">an easy entrée,</a> simply brush a fillet with mustard or mayonnaise and broil it. Bluefish also can be grilled, roasted or baked. Only small bluefish can be fried, since larger fish are too oily. Large fish can be baked whole.

    <h3><a href="7.html">Opah
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Years ago,  <a href="leaves/opah.html">opah</a> was thought to bring good luck, and Hawaiian fishermen gave the fish away as a goodwill gesture. But there was also a time when seafood suppliers could find no takers for the moonfish, likely named for its round profile. Opah’s popularity finally blossomed in the late ’80s when the state of Hawaii started promoting its underutilized species, and U.S. consumers acquired a taste for more boldly flavored fish. Opah isn’t consistently available, since the species doesn’t school and isn’t easily harvested in quantity. While known primarily as a  <a href="leaves/hawaiianspecies.html">Hawaiian species</a> in the domestic market, opah is found worldwide in tropical and temperate waters. It is often taken as bycatch by longliners targeting tuna from New Zealand to California and also is harvested off the California coast. Opah is imported into the U.S. market predominately from Fiji, Tahiti and New Zealand when domestic supplies are low. In earlier scientific references, opah was classified as Lampris regius.
 </p>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/oneopahhasfourtypesofflesh.html">One opah has four types of flesh,</a> each a different color. The tender meat of the loin, which runs along the backbone from eye to tail, is a light salmon-orange.

The less-tender, stringy side flesh is the same color as the loin at the top but becomes paler at the bottom. The cheek meat is dark red.

The flavor is a cross between tuna and swordfish — distinctive but not overpowering. The opah’s large-grain, fatty flesh offers a versatility of use that appeals to chefs. It also works well with assertive sauces. The loin yields steak-like fillets that are good for grilling, broiling or sautéing.  <a href="leaves/opahtoploinmeat.html">Opah top loin meat</a> makes excellent sashimi.

The flavor is a cross between tuna and swordfish — distinctive but not overpowering. The opah’s large-grain, fatty flesh offers a versatility of use that appeals to chefs. It also works well with assertive sauces. The loin yields steak-like fillets that are good for grilling, broiling or sautéing. Opah top loin meat makes excellent sashimi. The rest is too fibrous to be good raw but becomes very tender when cooked.

    <h3><a href="8.html">Dogfish
</a></h3>
        <p> This bone-free shark possesses many of the attributes U.S. consumers are looking for. Promoters hope to find greater acceptance for the  <a href="leaves/dogfish.html">dogfish</a> by marketing it under a Food-and-Drug-Administration-approved alternative name: “Cape shark.” Domestically, the species is found along the Pacific Coast from the Gulf of Alaska to Point Conception, California. On the Atlantic Coast, it roams between Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, and Cape Cod.  <a href="leaves/capeshark.html">Cape shark</a> is targeted by longliners and landed as a bycatch of gillnetters. Market size is about 3 feet, with an average weight of 7 to 10 pounds. Like all sharks,  <a href="leaves/dogfishareelasmobranchs.html">dogfish are elasmobranchs,</a> which means they have cartilage instead of bone for a skeleton. Sharks also lack a traditional urinary tract, so they concentrate urea, a waste product, in their blood and excrete it through their skin. As soon as it’s caught, dogfish must be gutted, bled and chilled. Otherwise, the urea remains in the flesh, and an ammonia smell develops within 24 hours.

        <p> The  <a href="leaves/ferociouslookingwolffishgets.html">ferocious-looking wolffish gets</a> its name from the sharp, protruding teeth it uses to feast on lobsters, clams and other shellfish.

Moi has a relatively high oil content that keeps the meat moist in a variety of preparation methods. Steam or bake whole fish or sear fillets, skin-side down, in a pan. Moi can also be grilled, broiled or pan fried and served raw as sashimi. The  <a href="leaves/oilintheflesh.html">oil in the flesh</a> makes smoking an option as well.

    <h3><a href="15.html">Abalone
</a></h3>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/wildabalone.html">Wild abalone</a> populations on the U.S. West Coast and worldwide have been decimated by predation, disease, loss of habitat and overfishing. However, farmed supply is alleviating the harvest shortfall; worldwide, more than 15 abalone species are commercially cultivated. The  <a href="leaves/mostpopularandcommonabalone.html">most popular and common abalone</a> in the North American market is the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), available as farmed product from California and both wild-harvested and farmed from Mexico. The only viable population of black abalone (H. cracherodii) in North America surrounds San Miguel Island off the southern California coast.  <a href="leaves/theaveragesizeofwildcaughtabalone.html">The average size of wild-caught abalone</a> is 12 inches, with meat weight averaging 1 pound per animal. Farmed abalone average about 4 inches in length. Grown either in onshore saltwater pens or in suspended cages, farmed abalone take three to four years to reach marketable size of four to six live animals per pound.
 </p>
        <p> Abs consist mainly of a large, strong foot, which is the edible meat. When cooked, abalone is milky-moist, tender and mild — somewhat like lobster, though sweeter to the sophisticated palate. Taste-wise, abalone is also a distant cousin to calamari.  <a href="leaves/culturedabalone.html">Cultured abalone</a> may be slightly more tender than wild-run.  <a href="leaves/frozenmeat.html">Frozen meat</a> should be firm, like an ivory-colored hockey puck. When thawed, it should have nearly no aroma. Cooked abalone appears in various shades of white. Live abalone should be active and stuck hard to the tank. The foot muscle should respond to touch. If it doesn’t, or if it dents, the animal is near death.
