    <h3><a href="thetaste.html">The taste</a></h3>
        <p>   The taste of most groupers is similar, with slight differences in flavor and texture, depending on size, species and location of harvest. Red grouper is sweeter and milder than black grouper, and many consider reds the better of the two. Once the skin is removed from the fish, itâ€™s hard to tell red and black grouper apart, but black grouper does have firmer meat in the fresh state.  The raw meat of both is white and lean with a notable lack of bones </p>
