        <p> Wolffish has long been held in high regard by  European chefs, who find it an acceptable alternative to Dover sole. The  lean, pearly white flesh of the wolffish has a firm texture and a mild, sweet flavor, sometimes likened to lobster. The meat has a flake similar to codâ€™s but not as large.  Wolffish skin is edible, but since there are no scales, this species cannot be kosher </p>
