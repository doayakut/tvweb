    <h3><a href="narrowbodiedpompano.html">narrowbodied pompano</a></h3>
        <p> Though technically a round fish, the  narrow-bodied pompano is structured much like a flatfish and generally weighs less than 3 pounds. The attractive, silvery skin is edible and does not require scaling.  Pompano meat is firm but finely flaked, with a sweet, mild flavor. The flesh is pearly white, with a moderate fat content, and cooks up white </p>
