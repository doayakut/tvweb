    <h3><a href="15.html">Abalone
</a></h3>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/wildabalone.html">Wild abalone</a> populations on the U.S. West Coast and worldwide have been decimated by predation, disease, loss of habitat and overfishing. However, farmed supply is alleviating the harvest shortfall; worldwide, more than 15 abalone species are commercially cultivated. The  <a href="leaves/mostpopularandcommonabalone.html">most popular and common abalone</a> in the North American market is the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), available as farmed product from California and both wild-harvested and farmed from Mexico. The only viable population of black abalone (H. cracherodii) in North America surrounds San Miguel Island off the southern California coast.  <a href="leaves/theaveragesizeofwildcaughtabalone.html">The average size of wild-caught abalone</a> is 12 inches, with meat weight averaging 1 pound per animal. Farmed abalone average about 4 inches in length. Grown either in onshore saltwater pens or in suspended cages, farmed abalone take three to four years to reach marketable size of four to six live animals per pound.

        <p> Abs consist mainly of a large, strong foot, which is the edible meat. When cooked, abalone is milky-moist, tender and mild — somewhat like lobster, though sweeter to the sophisticated palate. Taste-wise, abalone is also a distant cousin to calamari.  <a href="leaves/culturedabalone.html">Cultured abalone</a> may be slightly more tender than wild-run.  <a href="leaves/frozenmeat.html">Frozen meat</a> should be firm, like an ivory-colored hockey puck. When thawed, it should have nearly no aroma. Cooked abalone appears in various shades of white. Live abalone should be active and stuck hard to the tank. The foot muscle should respond to touch. If it doesn’t, or if it dents, the animal is near death.
