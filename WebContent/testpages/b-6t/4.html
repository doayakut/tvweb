        <p> Canvas is an  <a href="leaves/extremelyheavydutyplainwovenfabric.html">extremely heavy-duty plain-woven fabric</a> used for making sails, tents, marquees, backpacks, and other items for which sturdiness is required. It is also popularly used by artists as a painting surface, typically stretched across a wooden frame. It is also used in such fashion objects as handbags, electronic device cases and shoes. Canvas has become the most common support medium for oil painting, replacing wooden panels. One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a  <a href="leaves/frenchmadonna.html">French Madonna</a> with angels from around 1410 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. However,  <a href="leaves/panelpainting.html">panel painting</a> remained more common until the 16th century in Italy and the 17th century in Northern Europe. Mantegna and Venetian artists were among those leading the change; Venetian sail canvas was readily available and regarded as the best quality.
 </p>
        <p> Canvas is typically stretched across a wooden frame called a stretcher, and may be coated with gesso before it is to be used; this is to prevent oil paint from coming into direct contact with the canvas fibres, which will eventually cause the canvas to decay. A traditional and flexible chalk gesso is composed of lead carbonate and linseed oil, applied over a rabbit skin glue ground; a variation using titanium white pigment and calcium carbonate is rather brittle and susceptible to cracking. As lead-based paint is poisonous, care has to be taken in using it.  <a href="leaves/variousalternativeandmoreflexiblecanvas.html">Various alternative and more flexible canvas</a> primers are commercially available, the most popular being a synthetic latex paint composed of titanium dioxide and calcium carbonate, bound with a thermo-plastic emulsion. Many artists have painted onto unprimed canvas, such as Jackson Pollock, Kenneth Noland, Francis Bacon, Helen Frankenthaler,  <a href="leaves/danchristensen.html">Dan Christensen,</a> Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Color Field painters, Lyrical Abstractionists and others.
