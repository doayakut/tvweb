    <h3><a href="14.html">Flannel
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Flannel is a  <a href="leaves/softwovenfabric.html">soft woven fabric,</a> of various fineness. Flannel was originally made from carded wool or worsted yarn, but is now often made from either wool, cotton, or synthetic fibre. Flannel may be brushed to create extra softness or remain unbrushed. The brushing process is a mechanical process where a fine metal brush rubs the fabric to create fine fibers from the loosely spun yarns. Typically, flannel has either a single- or double-sided nap.  <a href="leaves/doublenappedflannel.html">Double-napped flannel</a> refers to a fabric that has been brushed on both sides. If the flannel is not napped, it gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn in its woven form. Flannel is commonly used to make  <a href="leaves/tartanclothing.html">tartan clothing,</a> blankets, bed sheets, and sleepwear. "Flannel shirt" is often mistakenly used to mean any shirt with a plaid or tartan pattern, rather than a shirt constructed of flannel fabric.
 </p>
        <p> At one time Welsh, Yorkshire, Lancashire and Irish flannels differed slightly in character due largely to the  <a href="leaves/gradeofrawwool.html">grade of raw wool</a> used in the several localities, some being softer and finer than others. While nowadays, the colour of flannel is determined by dyes, originally this was achieved through mixing white, blue, brown and black wools in varying proportions. Lighter shades were achieved by bleaching with sulphur dioxide.
