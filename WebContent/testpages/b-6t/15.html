    <h3><a href="15.html">Bamboo textiles
</a></h3>
        <p> Bamboo textiles are cloth, yarn, and clothing made out of bamboo fibres. While  <a href="leaves/historicallyusedonlyforstructuralelements.html">historically used only for structural elements,</a> such as bustles and the ribs of corsets, in recent years a range of technologies have been developed allowing bamboo fibre to be used in a wide range of textile and fashion applications. Modern bamboo clothing is clothing made from either 100% bamboo yarn or a blend of bamboo and cotton yarn. The bamboo yarn can also be blended with other textile fibres such as hemp or even spandex.  In China and Japan,  <a href="leaves/thinstripsofbamboo.html">thin strips of bamboo</a> were woven together into hats and shoes. One particular design of bamboo hats was associated with rural life, being worn almost universally by farmers and fishermen in order to protect their heads from the sun.In the West, bamboo, alongside other components such as whalebone and steel wire, was sometimes used as a structural component in corsets, bustles and other types of structural elements used in fashionable womenâ€™s dresses.

        <p>  <a href="leaves/bamboofibre.html">Bamboo fibre</a> is a cellulose fibre extracted or fabricated from natural bamboo (and possibly other additives) and is made from (or in the case of material fabrication, is) the pulp of bamboo plants. It is usually not made from the fibres of the plant, but is a synthetic viscose made from bamboo cellulose. Bamboo has gained popularity as a  <a href="leaves/greenfibre.html">"green" fibre</a>.Manufacturers tout the fact that bamboo can be cultivated quickly, can be used as a cash crop to develop impoverished regions of the third world, and is a natural fibre (as opposed to popular synthetics like polyester) whose cultivation results in a decrease in greenhouse gases.There may be environmental problems with the cultivation of land expressly for bamboo and the use of harsh chemicals to turn bamboo into usable fibre for clothing.Bamboo is  <a href="leaves/extremelyresilient.html">extremely resilient</a> and durable as a fiber. In studies comparing it to cotton and polyester, it is found to have a high breaking tenacity, better moisture wicking properties, and better moisture absorption.
