    <h3><a href="gradeofrawwool.html">grade of raw wool</a></h3>
        <p> At one time Welsh, Yorkshire, Lancashire and Irish flannels differed slightly in character due largely to the  grade of raw wool used in the several localities, some being softer and finer than others. While nowadays, the colour of flannel is determined by dyes, originally this was achieved through mixing white, blue, brown and black wools in varying proportions. Lighter shades were achieved by bleaching with sulphur dioxide.
