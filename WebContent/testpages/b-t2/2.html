    <h3><a href="2.html">Drama
</a></h3>
        <p> Drama is the specific mode of fiction  <a href="leaves/representedinperformance.html">represented in performance</a>. The term comes from a Greek word meaning "action", which is derived from the verb meaning "to do" or "to act". The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes  <a href="leaves/collaborativemodes.html">collaborative modes</a> of production and a  <a href="leaves/collectiveform.html">collective form</a> of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. The early modern tragedy Hamlet by Shakespeare and the classical Athenian tragedy Oedipus the King  by Sophocles are among the masterpieces of the art of drama. A modern example is Long Day's Journey into Night by Eugene O’Neill.

        <p> The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional  <a href="leaves/genericdivisionbetweencomedyandtragedy.html">generic division between comedy and tragedy</a>. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy, while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy.   <a href="leaves/thaliaswasportrayedasmanythings.html">Thalia’s was portrayed as many things</a>. Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since  <a href="leaves/aristotlespoetics.html">Aristotle's Poetics</a> —the earliest work of dramatic theory.
