    <h3><a href="0.html">Novel
</a></h3>
        <p> A novel is a long  <a href="leaves/prosenarrative.html">prose narrative</a> that describes  <a href="leaves/fictional.html">fictional</a> characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. The genre has historical roots in antiquity and medieval and early modern romance and in the tradition of the novella. The latter, an Italian word used to describe short stories, supplied the present generic English term in the 18th century. The first significant European novelist is Miguel de Cervantes, author of  <a href="leaves/donquixote.html">Don Quixote</a>. While a more precise definition of the genre is difficult, the main elements that critics discuss are: how the narrative, and especially the plot, is constructed, the themes, settings, and  <a href="leaves/characterization.html">characterization,</a> how language is used, and the way that plot, character, and setting relates to reality.
 </p>
        <p> The romance is a related long prose narrative.  <a href="leaves/walterscott.html">Walter Scott</a> defined this as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents", whereas in the novel "the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society". However, many romances, including the  <a href="leaves/historicalromances.html">historical romances</a> of Scott, Emily BrontÃ«'s Wuthering Heights and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a "kindred term". Romance, as defined here, should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or romance novel.
