    <h3><a href="speechinrhetoric.html">speech in rhetoric</a></h3>
        <p>  Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of  speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and  rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.
