    <h3><a href="selfcontainedincident.html">selfcontained incident</a></h3>
        <p>  At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a  self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a "single effect" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common  pool of literary techniques.
