    <h3><a href="1.html">Poem
</a></h3>
        <p> Poetry is a form of literary art which uses  <a href="leaves/aestheticandrhythmicqualities.html">aesthetic and rhythmic qualities</a> of language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.
 </p>
        <p> Poetry has a long history, dating back to the  <a href="leaves/sumerianepicofgilgamesh.html">Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh</a>. Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the  <a href="leaves/sanskritvedas.html">Sanskrit Vedas,</a> Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of  <a href="leaves/speechinrhetoric.html">speech in rhetoric,</a> drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and  <a href="leaves/rhyme.html">rhyme,</a> and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.
