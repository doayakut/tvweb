    <h3><a href="2.html">Orange wine
</a></h3>
        <p> Orange wine can be one of three very different types of wine.
 </p>
        <p> The term could refer to a beverage made by fermenting orange juice, rather than grape juice.
 </p>
        <p> Typically orange wine production involves crushing the grapes.
 </p>
        <p> Orange wines were common in Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.
