    <h3><a href="therawmeat.html">The raw meat</a></h3>
        <p>   The raw meat of both is white and lean with a notable lack of bones. Cooked, the white meat  has a very firm texture and heavy flake and remains moist. In the South,  blackened grouper is a favorite preparation, but this versatile fish can be fried, grilled, skewered or used in chowders and soups. Larger whole grouper can be roasted, and large fillets should be butterflied before grilling because of their thickness </p>
