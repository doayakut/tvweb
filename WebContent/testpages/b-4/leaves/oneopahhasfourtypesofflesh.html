    <h3><a href="oneopahhasfourtypesofflesh.html">One opah has four types of flesh</a></h3>
        <p>  One opah has four types of flesh, each a different color. The tender meat of the loin, which runs along the backbone from eye to tail, is a light salmon-orange. An  opah fish was recently caught in California. The less-tender, stringy side flesh is the same color as the loin at the top but becomes paler at the bottom </p>
