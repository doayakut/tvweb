    <h3><a href="fillets.html">Fillets</a></h3>
        <p>   Fillets shouldn’t have signs of browning, graying or yellowing. Rockfish generally fall into two categories: red-fleshed and brown-fleshed. Red-fleshed fillets are generally considered more desirable, because they are less oily and have a longer shelf life. Rockfish holds up well to baking and remains moist when cooked </p>

        <p>  Like all flatfish, a turbot yields four  fillets, with meatier back fillets than belly portions. Fillets from a 3- to 4-pound turbot are quite meaty; those from smaller fish can be rather thin. A rim of fatty tissue on the fin side of each fillet contains a row of “kernels” of snow-white meat. Treat turbot with the respect it deserves, using preparations that highlight the delicate flavor and bright-white flesh </p>
