        <p> If ever there were a fish with an identity crisis, it’s the lingcod, for despite its name, this species is neither a cod nor a ling. Rather, it’s a Pacific greenling, from the family Hexagrammidae.  <a href="leaves/recordlingcodcaught.html">Record Lingcod Caught</a>. The lingcod likely got the name ling from early settlers who related it to European lings but acknowledged its white flaky flesh by adding cod.  <a href="leaves/cultuscod.html">Cultus cod</a> was the name used most often in the early 1900s — an insult to this fine fish, as cultus means “of little worth” in Chinook. Lingcod ranges from Baja California to Kodiak Island and the Aleutian Peninsula. It is a bycatch of trawl and longline fisheries, though there is a targeted fishery in Southeast Alaska. The best lingcod is landed by hook-and-line boats that bleed and ice the fish immediately after harvest. Lingcod can grow to 90 pounds but typical market size is around 10 pounds. Don’t be alarmed by the blue-green tint of the raw meat. The color cooks out completely, leaving a snow-white piece of fish.  <a href="leaves/themildtastingmeatoflingcod.html">The mild-tasting meat of Lingcod</a> is tender yet firm, with large, soft, moist flakes.

        <p> A favorite in the Pacific Northwest for upscale fish and chips,  <a href="leaves/lingcodcanbepreparedmanyways.html">lingcod can be prepared many ways</a>. It works well on the grill, and large lingcod can be stuffed with vegetables and baked. Steaks and fillets are good baked with a topping such as a sun-dried tomato sauce. Steaks also may be steamed with herbs and spices. The density of the flesh requires a longer cooking time than that of other whitefish, but be careful not to overcook the lean meat.  <a href="leaves/cheaplingcod.html">Cheap lingcod</a> usually means trawl-caught fish, inferior to hook-and-line lingcod. But if you know a quality-conscious skipper who makes short trips, you can get a good buy on trawled product.
