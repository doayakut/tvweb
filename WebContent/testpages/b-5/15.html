    <h3><a href="15.html">Sony Cyber-shot QX10
</a></h3>
        <p> You have to give Sony credit for trying something new to stem declining point-and-shoot sales. The Cyber-shot DSC-QX10 and its  <a href="leaves/higherendlinematetheqx100.html">higher-end linemate, the QX100,</a> are essentially compact cameras redesigned for people who've forsaken standalone cameras for their smartphone's. The cameras wirelessly link to your smartphone (or tablet if you want) via a direct Wi-Fi connection and, with the help of Sony's PlayMemories Mobile app (for now, at least), let you use your device as a viewfinder and interface for the camera. Because of the way they look and physically attach to your smartphone, it would be easy to mistake them for some sort of  <a href="leaves/addonlens.html">add-on lens</a> that works with your smartphone's built-in camera, magically combining all the strengths of its shooter with the power of a zoom lens. There is no magic here, though, and perhaps that's what's most disappointing about the QX10.
 </p>
        <p> It's understandable why people are gobsmacked when they see the QX10. Here, in this small, lightweight cylinder, is not just a 10x zoom lens, but an entire camera. It has its own  <a href="leaves/sensorandprocessor.html">sensor and processor</a> and battery and memory card slot. All it's really missing is a screen -- which you supply with an Android or iOS smartphone or tablet -- and some controls, which you don't need since most things are handled with your device's touch screen. The need for a screen or viewfinder of some sort pretty much limits what you can do with a camera design. With no screen to deal with, you're just working the design around the lens. By going with the round body, it's not only more comfortable to hold when you're using it, but doesn't look too odd when attached to your smartphone.
