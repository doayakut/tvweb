    <h3><a href="11.html">Samsung DV150F Dual-View
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD

        <p> For the DV150F Dual-View Smart Camera, Samsung took two of its best point-and-shoot features and put them in one affordable camera. On the outside, you'll find an  <a href="leaves/lcdonback.html">LCD on back</a> for framing and viewing your shots as well as a smaller LCD on front for self-portraits. This second screen can also be used to display a short animation to get the attention of a small child or possibly a pet as well as a countdown when using the self-timer. Inside, there's a Wi-Fi radio for sending those self-portraits straight to a smartphone or tablet for instant uploading and sharing, or backing up on a computer or in cloud storage, or directly sending by e-mail or uploading to Facebook, among several other options.
 </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, Samsung also put inside an inferior sensor to the  <a href="leaves/backsideilluminatedbsi.html">backside-illuminated (BSI)</a> CMOS ones found in its slightly higher-end models, like the WB250F Smart Camera. The choice no doubt helped keep the price low, less than $150 in this case, but it also makes the DV150F less capable in low light without a flash. But, if you do most of your shooting outdoors in good light, the DV150F's two fun features make this reasonably priced problem-solving camera worth considering.
