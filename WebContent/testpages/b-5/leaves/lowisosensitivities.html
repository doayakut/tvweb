    <h3><a href="lowisosensitivities.html">low ISO sensitivities</a></h3>
        <p>  Like the G15, the G16 has excellent image quality at  low ISO sensitivities, but its performance is significantly improved -- still not the fastest option in its class, but no longer the slug it was. Its feature set continues to lag comparatively, but overall the camera remains a nice option for manual-control devotees who don't want to schlep around a dSLR and who still find compact interchangeable-lens cameras a bit too large.
