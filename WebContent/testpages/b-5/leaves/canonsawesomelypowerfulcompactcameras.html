        <p>   Canon's awesomely powerful compact cameras. As a camera, though, the G series is slowly improving. Given that it was once one of the cameras that defined the enthusiast category it's sad to see it slip compared with competitors. Like the G15, the G16 has excellent image quality at  low ISO sensitivities, but its performance is significantly improved -- still not the fastest option in its class, but no longer the slug it was </p>
