    <h3><a href="4.html">Pompano
</a></h3>
        <p> Gourmands describe the  <a href="leaves/atlanticpompano.html">Atlantic pompano</a> as “the world’s most edible fish.” The flat-bodied, pan-sized pompano is easy to eat whole, a form that shows off the beautiful, silvery skin. The species is harvested from Virginia to Texas, but primarily off Florida’s west coast. Commercial landings are limited, and as a result, prices remain high in most markets. This makes the pompano a tempting target for substitution — and an easy one, since there are several different species of pompano within the confusing Carangidae, or jack, family. The star of the clan, the Atlantic pompano, is often confused with  <a href="leaves/threelessdelectablerelatives.html">three less delectable relatives:</a> the similar-looking permit, the palometa and the gafftopsail pompano. But it’s not that difficult to tell the real McCoy: Any fish bigger than 3 pounds can be eliminated, since  <a href="leaves/marketsizedpompano.html">market-sized pompano</a> average 2 pounds.

        <p> Though technically a round fish, the  <a href="leaves/narrowbodiedpompano.html">narrow-bodied pompano</a> is structured much like a flatfish and generally weighs less than 3 pounds. The attractive, silvery skin is edible and does not require scaling.  <a href="leaves/pompanomeat.html">Pompano meat</a> is firm but finely flaked, with a sweet, mild flavor. The flesh is pearly white, with a moderate fat content, and cooks up white. Pompano lends itself to whole preparations since it is easy to eat off the bone. It can also be halved lengthwise to produce two long fillets. When serving, try to display the attractive skin. The simplest way to prepare pompano is to broil it with lemon and butter. Perhaps the most famous preparation for this fish is en papillote (cooked in parchment).

        <p> Pompanos are marine fishes in the Trachinotus genus of the Carangidae family (better known as “jacks”). Pompano may also refer to various other, similarly shaped members of Carangidae, or the order Perciformes. Their appearance is deep bodied and mackerel-like, typically silver and toothless with a forked tail and narrow base. There are twenty described species and most are valued as food. Some species are considered prize delicacies and game fish. A similar species is known as the permit, T. falcatus: two United States Navy submarines are named after it. The Florida pompano, T. carolinus, reaches about 45 centimeters (18 in) and 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb), while the permit reaches about 90 centimeters (35 in) and more than 14 kilograms (31 lb).

        <p> The Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus[1]) is a species of marine fish in the Trachinotus (pompano) genus of the Carangidae family. It has a compressed body and short snout; coloration varies from blue-greenish silver on the dorsal areas and silver to yellow on the body and fins. It can be found along the western coast of the Atlantic Ocean, depending on the season, and is popular for both sport and commercial fishing. Most Florida pompano caught weigh less than 3 pounds (1.4 kg) and are less than 17 inches (43 cm) long, though the largest individuals weigh 8–9 pounds (3.6–4.1 kg) and reach lengths of up to 26 inches (66 cm). Because it is fast-growing and desirable for food, the pompano is one of the many fish that are currently being farmed through aquaculture. The Florida city of Pompano Beach is named after the Florida pompano. There are different kinds of pompano, including African, Cayenne, Florida and Irish. The Florida Pompano (T. carolinus) is part of the jack family. It is very similar to the permit (Trachinotus falcatus). It has a deeply forked tail and is blue-greenish silver with yellow on the throat, belly, and pelvic and anal fins. The first dorsal fins are low, with about 6 separate spines. The first spine may be reabsorbed in a larger fish.
