    <h3><a href="0.html">Catfish
</a></h3>
        <p> Farming  <a href="leaves/catfish.html">catfish</a> is truly a U.S. seafood industry success story. It started in Arkansas in the 1960s and expanded into an economic powerhouse as Southern soybean and rice farmers built ponds and processing facilities. Most  <a href="leaves/catfishfarms.html">catfish farms</a> today are located in the Mississippi Delta, with additional production in Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana. A typical pond is 16 acres and produces 4,000 to 7,000 pounds of catfish per acre. The channel cat is possibly the fastest-growing catfish species in the world. And it’s one of the best protein converters: 1 pound of catfish for every 2 pounds of feed (compared to 7:1 for beef and 4:1 for pork). At market size (1 to 1 1/2 pounds), catfish are harvested and then transported live in tank trucks from the farms to processing plants, where they are processed immediately. Catfish is one of the most quality-controlled products in the food industry, and its farming is regulated by the  <a href="leaves/foodanddrugadministration.html">Food and Drug Administration</a>.
 </p>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/peopletellingcatfishstories.html">People telling Catfish Stories</a>. Uncooked catfish smells almost like raw chicken. Because it’s a grain-fed, farmed fish, catfish has a consistently sweet, mild taste. It absorbs other flavors readily. The moist, dense meat is firm and has less flake than the typical whitefish. Fresh catfish meat is white to off-white, sometimes pinkish, with noticeable translucency and iridescence. Cooked meat is opaque and white. Don’t buy it if it is reddish or slightly yellow. Also, don’t expect it to have the oceany odor of marine fish. Quality can fluctuate with water conditions and feed sources. Watch out for “specials” that might feature wild,  <a href="leaves/rivercaughtcatfish.html">river-caught catfish</a>. And don’t mistake ocean catfish, or wolffish, for farmed channel catfish.
 </p>
        <p> Catfishes (order Siluriformes) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat’s whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the heaviest and longest, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia and the second longest, the wels catfish of Eurasia, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, Vandellia cirrhosa. There are armour-plated types and also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbels; members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus Corydoras, are important in the aquarium hobby. Catfish are nocturnal.
 </p>
        <p> Most catfish are bottom feeders. In general, they are negatively buoyant, which means that they will usually sink rather than float due to a reduced gas bladder and a heavy, bony head.[6] Catfish have a variety of body shapes, though most have a cylindrical body with a flattened ventrum to allow for benthic feeding.[6]A flattened head allows for digging through the substrate as well as perhaps serving as a hydrofoil. Most have a mouth that can expand to a large size and contains no incisiform teeth; catfish generally feed through suction or gulping rather than biting and cutting prey.[6] However, some families, notably Loricariidae and Astroblepidae, have a suckermouth that allows them to fasten themselves to objects in fast-moving water. Catfish also have a maxilla reduced to a support for barbels; this means that they are unable to protrude their mouths as other fish such as carp.

    <h3><a href="1.html">Lingcod
</a></h3>

        <p> If ever there were a fish with an identity crisis, it’s the lingcod, for despite its name, this species is neither a cod nor a ling. Rather, it’s a Pacific greenling, from the family Hexagrammidae.  <a href="leaves/recordlingcodcaught.html">Record Lingcod Caught</a>. The lingcod likely got the name ling from early settlers who related it to European lings but acknowledged its white flaky flesh by adding cod.  <a href="leaves/cultuscod.html">Cultus cod</a> was the name used most often in the early 1900s — an insult to this fine fish, as cultus means “of little worth” in Chinook. Lingcod ranges from Baja California to Kodiak Island and the Aleutian Peninsula. It is a bycatch of trawl and longline fisheries, though there is a targeted fishery in Southeast Alaska. The best lingcod is landed by hook-and-line boats that bleed and ice the fish immediately after harvest. Lingcod can grow to 90 pounds but typical market size is around 10 pounds. Don’t be alarmed by the blue-green tint of the raw meat. The color cooks out completely, leaving a snow-white piece of fish.  <a href="leaves/themildtastingmeatoflingcod.html">The mild-tasting meat of Lingcod</a> is tender yet firm, with large, soft, moist flakes.

        <p> A favorite in the Pacific Northwest for upscale fish and chips,  <a href="leaves/lingcodcanbepreparedmanyways.html">lingcod can be prepared many ways</a>. It works well on the grill, and large lingcod can be stuffed with vegetables and baked. Steaks and fillets are good baked with a topping such as a sun-dried tomato sauce. Steaks also may be steamed with herbs and spices. The density of the flesh requires a longer cooking time than that of other whitefish, but be careful not to overcook the lean meat.  <a href="leaves/cheaplingcod.html">Cheap lingcod</a> usually means trawl-caught fish, inferior to hook-and-line lingcod. But if you know a quality-conscious skipper who makes short trips, you can get a good buy on trawled product.
 </p>
        <p> Lingcod are unique to the west coast of North America, with the center of abundance off the coast of British Columbia. They are found on the bottom, with most individuals occupying rocky areas at depths of 10 to 100 m (32 to 328 feet). Tagging studies have shown lingcod are a largely nonmigratory species, with colonization and recruitment occurring in localized areas only.[6]Starting in October, lingcod migrate to nearshore spawning grounds. The males migrate first, and establish nest sites in strong current areas in rock crevices or on ledges. Spawning takes place between December and March, and females leave the nest site immediately after depositing eggs. Males actively defend the nest from predators until the eggs hatch in early March through late April.
 </p>
        <p> The larvae are pelagic until late May or early June, when they settle to the bottom as juveniles. Initially they inhabit eel grass beds, then move to flat, sandy areas that are not the typical habitat of older lingcod. They eventually settle in habitats of similar relief and substrate as older lingcod, but remain at shallower depths for several years. Females and males mature at age three to five years (61–75 cm) and two years of age (45 cm), respectively. An adult male can be distinguished externally from a female by the presence of a small, conical papilla behind the anal vent. Up to age two, males and females grow at similar rates, with both reaching an average length of 45 cm. After age two, females grow faster than males, with the growth of males tapering off at about age eight, and females continuing to grow until about age 12 to 14. Lingcod live a maximum of about 14 years for males and 20 years for females, reaching a maximum size of approximately 90 cm and 120 cm, respectively. Off the coast of Alaska, many reach 70 pounds (32 kilograms).
 </p>
    
    <h3><a href="2.html">Turbot
</a></h3>
        <p> Found on menus in the whitest of white-tablecloth restaurants, turbot (pronounced tur-bet) is a favored flatfish for discerning chefs. A member of the Bothidae, or left-eyed, family of flounders, turbot (previously known as Psetta maxima) is found in shallow inshore waters throughout the Mediterranean and north to the Norwegian Sea.  <a href="leaves/primaryproducers.html">Primary producers</a> are the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Global supplies are limited, which accounts for the high price this fish commands. Farmed production in France, Spain and Chile is supplementing wild harvests.  <a href="leaves/farmraisedturbot.html">Farm-raised turbot</a> are generally smaller (1 to 4 pounds) and milder in flavor than wild turbot, which can reach 30 pounds but average 10 pounds. Several lesser-quality species of flatfish are sometimes passed off as European turbot, including  <a href="leaves/greenlandturbot.html">Greenland turbot</a> and some West Coast flounders. Inferior in flavor and with softer flesh, these flatfish can’t compare to the real turbot.
 </p>
        <p> Turbot has  <a href="leaves/gleamingflesh.html">gleaming flesh</a> that retains its bright-white appearance when cooked. The firm meat has a large flake and an excellent mild flavor. Like all flatfish, a turbot yields four  <a href="leaves/fillets.html">fillets,</a> with meatier back fillets than belly portions. Fillets from a 3- to 4-pound turbot are quite meaty; those from smaller fish can be rather thin. A rim of fatty tissue on the fin side of each fillet contains a row of “kernels” of snow-white meat. Treat turbot with the respect it deserves, using preparations that highlight the delicate flavor and bright-white flesh. Turbot is good baked whole; the bones add flavor. Fillets can be overcooked in dry heat; steaming, poaching and pan-frying are preferable to grilling.
 </p>
        <p> The word comes from the Old French tourbout, which in turn is thought to be a derivative of the Latin turbo (“spinning top”) a possible reference to its shape.[1] Early reference to the Turbot can be found in a satirical poem (The Emperor’s Fish) by Juvenal, a Roman poet of the late 1st and early 2nd centuries A.D., suggesting this fish was a delicacy in the Roman empire. In the UK, Turbot is pronounced /ˈtɜrbət/ TUR-bət. In the US it is pronounced /ˈtɜrboʊ/ TUR-boh (the French pronunciation of “turbot” is [tyʁbo]). In Turkey, where the fish is popular and expensive, it is called “Kalkan” – “shield” – due to the fish’s resemblance to the item. Instead of a smooth skin, Kalkan (Scophthalmus maeoticus), which is from the Black Sea, has small spikes on both sides; it is considered a subspecies of the Mediterranean Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). The turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a species of flatfish in the family Scophthalmidae. It is a demersal fish native to marine or brackish waters of the North Atlantic, Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.
 </p>
        <p> The turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a large left-eyed flatfish found primarily close to shore in sandy shallow waters throughout the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the North Atlantic. The European turbot has an asymmetrical disk-shaped body, and has been known to grow up to 100 cm (39 in) long and 25 kg (55 lb) in weight.[2]Turbot is highly prized as a food fish for its delicate flavour, and is also known as breet, britt or butt. It is a valuable commercial species, acquired through aquaculture and trawling. Turbot are farmed in France, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Chile, Norway, and China.
 </p>
    
    <h3><a href="3.html">Bream
</a></h3>
        <p> This high-valued species is the favored  <a href="leaves/seabream.html">sea bream,</a> prized in Mediterranean cuisine and highly regarded by European chefs. It gets the “gilt-head” name from the golden stripe between its eyes. The Romans reportedly called the bream “Aurata,” the gilded one. The Greek goddess Aphrodite also considered the gilt-head bream sacred. The fish reach maturity during their second year, up to which time they are male. In the third year, for reasons not fully understood, they become female. Sea bream are found in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, but commercial harvests are small. As with European sea bass, bream is increasingly supplied by aquaculture operations, mostly in the Mediterranean. Some is also raised in Iceland in geothermic water. A small member of the  <a href="leaves/porgyfamily.html">porgy family,</a> Sparidae, sea bream usually run 10 to 14 inches long and between 1 1/4 and 6 pounds. Upscale chefs in the United States menu  <a href="leaves/breambyitsfrenchname.html">bream by its French name,</a> daurade, or daurade royale.
 </p>
        <p> The  <a href="leaves/rosycoloredraw.html">rosy-colored raw</a> meat turns white when cooked. Bream’s moist flesh has a rich, sweet flavor. The texture is firm but tender. Daurade is best cooked whole, dressed but with the backbone left in. Because the flesh holds together well, it can be braised and used in stews. It is the fish traditionally featured in bouillabaisse. The fish is excellent poached in wine. It can also be stuffed and baked, grilled or sautéed. A lesser bream, Pagellus bogaraveo, or red bream, is known by  <a href="leaves/thefrenchname.html">the French name</a> dorade communue; don’t confuse it with the superior daurade royale, Sparus auratus.
 </p>
        <p> The bream is usually 30 to 55 cm (12 to 22 in) long, though some specimens of 75 cm (30 in) have been recorded; it usually weighs 2 to 4 kg (4.4 to 8.8 lb). The maximum length is 90 cm (35.5 in) with a maximum recorded weight of about 9.1 kg (20 lb). It has a laterally flattened and high-backed body and a slightly undershot mouth. It is a silvery grey colour, though older fish can be bronze-coloured especially in clear waters. The fins are greyish to black, but never reddish. The common bream can easily be confused with the silver or white bream (Blicca bjoerkna), in particular at the younger stages (see picture). The most reliable method of distinguishing these species is by counting the scales in a straight line downwards from the first ray of the dorsal fin to the lateral line. Silver bream have fewer than 10 rows of scales, while common bream have 11 or more. At the adult stage the reddish tint of the pectoral fin of the silver bream is diagnostic. Like other Cyprinidae, common bream can easily hybridise with other species, and hybrids with roach (Rutilus rutilus) can be very difficult to distinguish from pure-bred bream.[2]
 </p>
        <p> The common bream lives in schools near the bottom. At night common bream can feed close to the shore and in clear waters with sandy bottoms feeding pits can be seen during daytime. The fish’s protractile mouth helps it dig for chironomid larvae, Tubifex worms, bivalves, and gastropods. The bream eats water plants and plankton, as well. In very turbid waters, common bream can occur in large numbers, which may result in a shortage of bottom-living prey such as chironomids. The bream are then forced to live by filter feeding with their gill rakers, Daphnia water fleas being the main prey. As the fish grows, the gill rakers become too far apart to catch small prey and the bream will not then grow bigger than 40 cm (16 in).[citation needed] If a common bream is malnourished, it can develop a so-called “knife back”, a sharp edge along its back.
 </p>
    
    <h3><a href="4.html">Pompano
</a></h3>
        <p> Gourmands describe the  <a href="leaves/atlanticpompano.html">Atlantic pompano</a> as “the world’s most edible fish.” The flat-bodied, pan-sized pompano is easy to eat whole, a form that shows off the beautiful, silvery skin. The species is harvested from Virginia to Texas, but primarily off Florida’s west coast. Commercial landings are limited, and as a result, prices remain high in most markets. This makes the pompano a tempting target for substitution — and an easy one, since there are several different species of pompano within the confusing Carangidae, or jack, family. The star of the clan, the Atlantic pompano, is often confused with  <a href="leaves/threelessdelectablerelatives.html">three less delectable relatives:</a> the similar-looking permit, the palometa and the gafftopsail pompano. But it’s not that difficult to tell the real McCoy: Any fish bigger than 3 pounds can be eliminated, since  <a href="leaves/marketsizedpompano.html">market-sized pompano</a> average 2 pounds.

        <p> Though technically a round fish, the  <a href="leaves/narrowbodiedpompano.html">narrow-bodied pompano</a> is structured much like a flatfish and generally weighs less than 3 pounds. The attractive, silvery skin is edible and does not require scaling.  <a href="leaves/pompanomeat.html">Pompano meat</a> is firm but finely flaked, with a sweet, mild flavor. The flesh is pearly white, with a moderate fat content, and cooks up white. Pompano lends itself to whole preparations since it is easy to eat off the bone. It can also be halved lengthwise to produce two long fillets. When serving, try to display the attractive skin. The simplest way to prepare pompano is to broil it with lemon and butter. Perhaps the most famous preparation for this fish is en papillote (cooked in parchment).

        <p> Pompanos are marine fishes in the Trachinotus genus of the Carangidae family (better known as “jacks”). Pompano may also refer to various other, similarly shaped members of Carangidae, or the order Perciformes. Their appearance is deep bodied and mackerel-like, typically silver and toothless with a forked tail and narrow base. There are twenty described species and most are valued as food. Some species are considered prize delicacies and game fish. A similar species is known as the permit, T. falcatus: two United States Navy submarines are named after it. The Florida pompano, T. carolinus, reaches about 45 centimeters (18 in) and 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb), while the permit reaches about 90 centimeters (35 in) and more than 14 kilograms (31 lb).
 </p>
        <p> The Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus[1]) is a species of marine fish in the Trachinotus (pompano) genus of the Carangidae family. It has a compressed body and short snout; coloration varies from blue-greenish silver on the dorsal areas and silver to yellow on the body and fins. It can be found along the western coast of the Atlantic Ocean, depending on the season, and is popular for both sport and commercial fishing. Most Florida pompano caught weigh less than 3 pounds (1.4 kg) and are less than 17 inches (43 cm) long, though the largest individuals weigh 8–9 pounds (3.6–4.1 kg) and reach lengths of up to 26 inches (66 cm). Because it is fast-growing and desirable for food, the pompano is one of the many fish that are currently being farmed through aquaculture. The Florida city of Pompano Beach is named after the Florida pompano. There are different kinds of pompano, including African, Cayenne, Florida and Irish. The Florida Pompano (T. carolinus) is part of the jack family. It is very similar to the permit (Trachinotus falcatus). It has a deeply forked tail and is blue-greenish silver with yellow on the throat, belly, and pelvic and anal fins. The first dorsal fins are low, with about 6 separate spines. The first spine may be reabsorbed in a larger fish.

        <p> The bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) is the only extant species of the family Pomatomidae. It is a marine pelagic fish found around the world in temperate and subtropical waters, except for the northern Pacific Ocean. Bluefish are known as tailor in Australia,[1] shad on the east coast of South Africa, elf on the west coast, γοφάρι (gofari) or λουφάρι (loufari) in modern Greek, and similarly, lüfer[2] in Turkish and луфарь/lufar in Russian. Other common names are blue, chopper, and anchoa.[3] It is good eating and a popular gamefish. The bluefish is a moderately proportioned fish, with a broad, forked tail. The spiny first dorsal fin is normally folded back in a groove, as are its pectoral fins. Coloration is a grayish blue-green dorsally, fading to white on the lower sides and belly. Its single row of teeth in each jaw are uniform in size, knife-edged, and sharp. Bluefish commonly range in size from seven-inch (18-cm) “snappers” to much larger, sometimes weighing as much as 40 pounds (18 kg), though fish heavier than 20 pounds (9 kg) are exceptional.
 </p>
        <p> Bluefish are widely distributed around the world in tropical and subtropical waters. They are found in pelagic waters on much of the continental shelves along eastern America (though not between south Florida and northern South America), Africa, the Mediterranean and Black Seas (and during migration in between), Southeast Asia, and Australia. They are found in a variety of coastal habitats: above the continental shelf, in energetic waters near surf beaches, or by rock headlands.[4] They also enter estuaries and inhabit brackish waters.[5][6][7] Periodically, they leave the coasts and migrate in schools through open waters.[8][9]

        <p> A traditional method of processing and preserving anchovies is to gut and salt them in brine, allow them to mature, and then pack them in oil or salt. This results in a characteristic strong flavor and the flesh turns deep grey. Pickled in vinegar, as with Spanish boquerones, anchovies are milder and the flesh retains a white color. In Roman times, anchovies were the base for the fermented fish sauce garum. Garum had a sufficiently long shelf life for long-distance commerce, and was produced in industrial quantities. Anchovies were also eaten raw as an aphrodisiac.[27] Today they are used in small quantities to flavor many dishes. Because of the strong flavor, they are also an ingredient in several sauces and condiments, including Worcestershire sauce, Caesar salad dressing, remoulade, Gentleman’s Relish, many fish sauces, and in some versions of Café de Paris butter. For domestic use, anchovy fillets are packed in oil or salt in small tins or jars, sometimes rolled around capers. Anchovy paste is also available. Fishermen also use anchovies as bait for larger fish, such as tuna and sea bass.
 </p>
        <p> The strong taste people associate with anchovies is due to the curing process. Fresh anchovies, known in Italy as alici, have a much milder flavor.[28] In Sweden and Finland, the name anchovies is related strongly to a traditional seasoning, hence the product “anchovies” is normally made of sprats[29] and also herring can be sold as “anchovy-spiced”. Fish from the Engraulidae family is instead known as “sardell” in Sweden and “sardelli” in Finland, leading to confusion when translating recipes.
 </p>
        <p> Anchovies are found in scattered areas throughout the world’s oceans, but are concentrated in temperate waters, and are rare or absent in very cold or very warm seas. They are generally very accepting of a wide range of temperatures and salinity.

        <p> Opah (also commonly known as moonfish, sunfish, kingfish, redfin ocean pan, and Jerusalem haddock) are large, colorful, deep-bodied pelagic Lampriform fish comprising the small family Lampridae (also spelled Lamprididae). There are only two living species in a single genus: Lampris (from the Greek lamprid-, “brilliant” or “clear”). One species is found in tropical to temperate waters of most oceans, while the other is limited to a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Ocean, with the 34th parallel as its northern limit. Two additional species, one in the genus Lampris and the other in the monotypic Megalampris Gottfried, Fordyce & Rust, 2006, are only known from fossil remains. The extinct family, Turkmenidae, from the Paleogene of Central Asia, is closely related, though much smaller.
 </p>
        <p> Opah are rarely caught by recreational anglers. They are prized trophies for deep-water anglers as their large size and attractive form lend themselves well to taxidermy. Opah are frequently caught as bycatch in many longline tuna fisheries. Opah is becoming increasingly popular in seafood markets. It first became popular as a sushi and sashimi in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The meat is lightly flavored and lends itself well to a variety of preparations, principally saute. Opah flesh has a light pink to orange color, but turns white when cooked. It is popular in Hawaii, especially in restaurants. An average of 35 percent of an opah’s weight is consumable, with the remaining 65% being bone and thick skin.

        <p> The S. canicula are small, shallow-water sharks with a slender shaped body with a blunt head. The two dorsal fins are located towards the tail end of the body. The texture of their skin is rough, similar to the coarseness of sandpaper.[4] The nostrils are located on the underside of the snout and are connected to the mouth by a curved groove. The underside is a lighter greyish-white colour and the upper side is greyish-brown with darker spots. Dorsal colour is sandy and tightly tan, with numerous small spots and dark brown or nearly black in colour. The teeth of S. canicula in males are larger than in females. In male S. canicula from West African waters, their jaws are stronger, larger and more calcinated. The reasons for the changes in their mouth dimensions during maturation could explain their feeding habits and adaptations for reproductive behavior.[5]
 </p>
        <p> Reproduction is oviparous. They deposit egg-cases that are protected by a horny capsule with long tendrils. The deposited egg-cases are mostly on macroalgae in shallow coastal waters. When the egg-cases are deposited farther from shore, they are placed on sessile erect invertebrates. These eggs usually measure 4 cm by 2 cm, without ever exceeding 6 cm.[6] These egg-cases can be found around the coasts of Europe. The embryos develop for 5–11 months, depending on the sea temperature and the young are born with a measurement of 9–10 cm. Spawning can take place almost all year round.[6] However, there are can be seasonal patterns in spawning activity as well. For example, S. canicula females that are located off the Mediterranean coast of France, lay their eggs from March to June and in December. In the waters surrounding Great Britain, egg laying occurs in spring with a gap between August and October.

        <p> Genypterus capensis (Smith, 1847), commonly known as Kingklip, is a species of cusk eel occurring along the Southern African coast from Walvis Bay in Namibia to Algoa Bay in South Africa, and is closely related to Genypterus blacodes from New Zealand. The species grows to a maximum length of 180 cm, a weight of 15.0 kg, and is one of the most popular fish items on South African menus. Despite appearances it is not closely related to the eel family of Anguilliformes.
 </p>
        <p> Kingklip occur at depths from 50 – 500 m, but usually in the range 250 – 350 m. They are bottom-dwelling and inhabit rocky localities on the shelf and upper continental slope. Juveniles are more often found in shallow waters. They feed on dragonets, mantis shrimps, hake, squid, and various fish species. Spawning usually takes place from August to October. The species is oviparous, with oval pelagic eggs floating in a gelatinous mass. Their dorsal soft rays number 150, while the anal soft rays number 110. The head and body are normally pink to orange in colour, with dark blotches dorsally. Andrew Smith, the redoubtable Scots explorer and zoologist, first described the Kingklip in 1847 from a specimen caught near the entrance to Table Bay and named it Xiphiurus capensis (‘xiphos’=sword, ‘oura’=tail). His description was published in “Illustrations of the zoology of South Africa”, an account of the natural history objects he collected during his expedition into the interior of South Africa in 1834-36. It was also described by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1858 and named Hoplophycis lalandi. [1]
 </p>
        <p> Kingklip were heavily exploited in the 1980s, and populations have not yet recovered so that some precautions are in place. Being relatively slow-growing and long-lived, stocks cannot sustain the pressure of targeted fishing, and are taken only as a bycatch species.

        <p> Groupers belong to one of the largest and  <a href="leaves/mostwidelydistributedfamiliesoffish.html">most widely distributed families of fish,</a> the sea basses. Red grouper (Epinephelus morio) is the most frequently seen grouper in the marketplace and is valued for its availability, flavor and size. Because of limited commercial supplies of the true black grouper (Mycteroperca spp.), it has largely been replaced by the gag (M. micro-lepis), which offers similar edibility and value. Some processors call gag “the grouper of choice,” since it offers better yield and firmer meat. It is referred to in the market as black grouper. Market size for black grouper is around 20 pounds, and red grouper is marketed at anywhere from 5 to 15 pounds.  <a href="leaves/groupersarefoundintemperatewaters.html">Groupers are found in temperate waters</a> from the Mid-Atlantic states and Florida to South America, Central America and the Gulf of Mexico.

Because of limited commercial supplies of the true black grouper (Mycteroperca spp.), it has largely been replaced by the gag (M. micro-lepis), which offers similar edibility and value. Some processors call gag “the grouper of choice,” since it offers better yield and firmer meat. It is referred to in the market as black grouper. Market size for black grouper is around 20 pounds, and red grouper is marketed at anywhere from 5 to 15 pounds. Groupers are found in temperate waters from the Mid-Atlantic states and Florida to South America, Central America and the Gulf of Mexico. Groupers are typically caught by hook and line.
 </p>
        <p> Groupers have a mild but distinct flavor, somewhere between bass and halibut. The taste of most groupers is similar, with slight differences in flavor and texture, depending on size, species and location of harvest. Red grouper is sweeter and milder than black grouper, and many consider reds the better of the two. Once the skin is removed from the fish, it’s hard to tell red and black grouper apart, but black grouper does have firmer meat in the fresh state. The raw meat of both is white and lean with a notable lack of bones. Cooked, the white meat  has a very firm texture and heavy flake and remains moist. In the South, blackened grouper is a favorite preparation, but this versatile fish can be fried, grilled, skewered or used in chowders and soups. Larger whole grouper can be roasted, and large fillets should be butterflied before grilling because of their thickness. Grouper is very forgiving; it can be overcooked and still remain moist.

        <p> Groupers are teleosts, typically having a stout body and a large mouth. They are not built for long-distance, fast swimming. They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon, though obviously in such a large group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Some species prefer to ambush their prey, while other species are active predators. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.[6]
 </p>
        <p> Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out of a cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in. Some research indicates roving coralgroupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus) sometimes cooperate with giant morays in hunting.[7]
 </p>
        <p> Groupers are mostly monandric protogynous hermaphrodites, i.e. they mature only as females and have the ability to change sex after sexual maturity.[8][9] Some species of groupers grow about a kilogram per year and are generally adolescent until they reach three kilograms, when they become female. The largest males often control harems containing three to 15 females.[8][10] Groupers often pair spawn, which enables large males to competitively exclude smaller males from reproducing.

        <p> The Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus), also known as the seawolf, Atlantic catfish, ocean catfish, devil fish, wolf eel (the common name for its Pacific relative), or sea cat, is a marine fish, the largest of the wolffish family Anarhichadidae. The numbers of the Atlantic wolffish are rapidly being depleted apparently due to overfishing and bycatch, and is currently a Species of Concern according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service.[1] Although it looks fearsome, the Atlantic wolffish is only a threat to humans when defending itself out of the water.[citation needed] Apart from their unique appearance wolffish are distinguished by the natural antifreeze they produce to keep their blood moving fluidly in their very cold habitat, involvement by both the male and female in brood bearing, and the large size of their eggs. They are also an important factor in controlling green crab and sea urchin populations, which can become overly disruptive to habitats if left unchecked. Wolffish population success is also an important indicator of the health of other bottom-dweller populations, such as cod.[2]
 </p>
        <p> In spite of its large size, the Atlantic wolffish has retained the bodily form and general external characteristics of small blennies (Blennioidei). The largest specimen recorded measured 150 cm (almost 5 ft) long and weighed almost 18 kg (40 lbs)[3] Its body is long, subcylindrical in front, compressed in the caudal portion, smooth and slippery, the rudimentary scales being embedded and almost hidden in the skin. Atlantic wolffish vary in color, usually seen as purplish-brown, a dull olive green, or blueish gray.[4] An even dorsal fin extends the whole length of the back, and a similar fin from the vent to the caudal fin, as in blennies. The pectorals are large and rounded and the pelvic fins are entirely absent. Its obtuse, eel-like body type makes the fish swim slowly, undulating from side to side, like an eel.[5]

        <p> Sebastes is a genus of fish in the family Sebastidae (though some include this in Scorpaenidae), most of which have the common name of rockfish. A few are called ocean perch, sea perch or redfish instead. Most of the Sebastes species live in the north Pacific, although two (S. capensis and S. oculatus) live in the south Pacific/Atlantic and four (S. fasciatus, S. mentella, S. norvegicus and S. viviparus) live in the north Atlantic. The coast off South California is the area of highest rockfish diversity, with 56 species living in the Southern California Bight. The fossil record of rockfish goes back to the Miocene, from California and Japan (although fossil otoliths from Belgium, “Sebastes” weileri, may push the record back as far as the Oligocene).
 </p>
        <p> Rockfish are an important sport and commercial fish, and many species have been overfished. As a result seasons are tightly controlled in many areas. Sebastes are sometimes fraudulently substituted for the more expensive red snapper (L. campechanus).[3]  Rockfish range from the intertidal zone to almost 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) deep, usually living benthically on various substrates, often (as the name suggests) around rock outcrops. Some rockfish species are very long-lived, amongst the longest-living fish on earth, with several species known to surpass 100 years of age, and a maximum reported age of 205 years for S. aleutianus.[4]
 </p>
        <p> Like all carnivores, these fish can bioaccumulate some pollutants or radionuclides as cesium. Highly radioactive rockfish have been caught in a port near Fukushima city, Japan, not far from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, nearly two years after the nuclear disaster (ex: 107000 Bq/kg[5] (2013-02-12) ; 116000 Bq/kg[5] (2013-02-13) and 132000Bq/kg[5] (2013-02-13), respectively 1070, 1160 and 1320 more than Japanese standard time (as updated on April 1, 2012[5]).

        <p> The two subfamilies appear to be morphologically different, with members of Branchiosteginae having deep bodies, large heads, and large, somewhat subterminal mouths. In contrast, members of Malacanthinae are slender with elongated bodies, smaller heads, and terminal mouths.
 </p>
        <p> Tilefish range in size from 11 cm (yellow tilefish, Hoplolatilus luteus) to 125 cm (great northern tilefish, Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps) and a weight of 30 kg. Both subfamilies have long dorsal and anal fins, the latter having one or two spines. The gill covers (opercula) have one spine which may be sharp or blunt; some species also have a cutaneous ridge atop the head. The tail fin may range in shape from truncated to forked. Most species are fairly low-key in colour, commonly shades of yellow, brown, and gray. Notable exceptions include three small, vibrant Hoplolatilus species: the purple sand tilefish (H. purpureus), Starck’s tilefish (H. starcki) and the redback sand tilefish (H. marcosi).
 </p>
        <p> Tilefish larvae are notable for their generous complement of spines and serrations on the head and scales. This feature also explains the family name Malacanthidae, from the Greek words mala meaning “many” and akantha meaning “thorn”. Generally shallow-water fish, tilefish are usually found at depths of 50–200 m in both temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. All species seek shelter in self-made burrows, caves at the bases of reefs, or piles of rock, often in canyons or at the edges of steep slopes. Either gravelly or sandy substrate may be preferred, depending on the species. Most species are strictly marine; an exception is found in the blue blanquillo (Malacanthus latovittatus) which is known to enter the brackish waters of Papua New Guinea’s Goldie River.

Found in tropical to subtropical waters throughout the world, the threadfin family contains nine genera and 33 species. An unrelated species sometimes known by the name threadfin, Alectis indicus, is properly the Indian threadfish (family Carangidae). Ranging in length from 20 centimeters (7.9 in) in the black-finned threadfin (Polydactylus nigripinnis) to 200 centimeters (79 in) in fourfinger threadfins (Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), threadfins are both important to commercial fisheries as a food fish, and popular among anglers. Their habit of forming large schools makes the threadfins a reliable and economic catch.
 </p>
        <p> Their bodies are elongate and fusiform, with spinous and soft dorsal fins widely separate. Their tail fins are large and deeply forked; indicating speed and agility. The mouth is large and inferior; a blunt snout projects far ahead. The jaws and palate possess bands of villiform (fibrous) teeth. Their most distinguishing feature is their pectoral fins: they are composed of two distinct sections, the lower of which consists of between 3-7 long, thread-like independent rays. In Polynemus species there may be up to 15 of these modified rays.
 </p>
        <p> In some species, such as the royal threadfin (Pentanemus quinquarius), the thread-like rays may extend well past the tail fin. This feature explains both the common name threadfin and the family name Polynemidae, from the Greek poly meaning “many” and nema meaning “filament.” Similar species, such as the mullets (family Mugilidae) and milkfish (family Chanidae) can be easily distinguished from threadfins by their lack of filamentous pectoral rays.

    <h3><a href="15.html">Abalone
</a></h3>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/wildabalone.html">Wild abalone</a> populations on the U.S. West Coast and worldwide have been decimated by predation, disease, loss of habitat and overfishing. However, farmed supply is alleviating the harvest shortfall; worldwide, more than 15 abalone species are commercially cultivated. The  <a href="leaves/mostpopularandcommonabalone.html">most popular and common abalone</a> in the North American market is the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), available as farmed product from California and both wild-harvested and farmed from Mexico. The only viable population of black abalone (H. cracherodii) in North America surrounds San Miguel Island off the southern California coast.  <a href="leaves/theaveragesizeofwildcaughtabalone.html">The average size of wild-caught abalone</a> is 12 inches, with meat weight averaging 1 pound per animal. Farmed abalone average about 4 inches in length. Grown either in onshore saltwater pens or in suspended cages, farmed abalone take three to four years to reach marketable size of four to six live animals per pound.
 </p>
        <p> Abs consist mainly of a large, strong foot, which is the edible meat. When cooked, abalone is milky-moist, tender and mild — somewhat like lobster, though sweeter to the sophisticated palate. Taste-wise, abalone is also a distant cousin to calamari.  <a href="leaves/culturedabalone.html">Cultured abalone</a> may be slightly more tender than wild-run.  <a href="leaves/frozenmeat.html">Frozen meat</a> should be firm, like an ivory-colored hockey puck. When thawed, it should have nearly no aroma. Cooked abalone appears in various shades of white. Live abalone should be active and stuck hard to the tank. The foot muscle should respond to touch. If it doesn’t, or if it dents, the animal is near death.
 </p>
        <p> The shell of abalones is convex, rounded to oval shape, and may be highly arched or very flattened. The shell is generally ear-shaped, presenting a small flat spire and two to three whorls. The last whorl (known as the body whorl) is auriform, meaning that the shell resembles an ear, giving rise to the common name “ear shell”. The “ass’s ear” abalone has a somewhat different shape, as it is more elongated and distended. The shell of Haliotis cracherodii cracherodii Leach, 1814 is also unusual: it has an ovate form, it is imperforate, shows an exserted spire, and has prickly ribs.
 </p>
        <p> A mantle cleft in the shell impresses a groove in the shell, in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus. They are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column. These holes make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows. This series of 8 to 38 holes is near the anterior margin. Only a small number are generally open. The older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form. Each abalone species has a typical number of open holes in the selenizone. There are four to ten of these holes, depending on the species. Abalone have no operculum. The aperture of the shell is very wide and nacreous.
 </p>
        <p> The exterior of the shell is striated and dull. The color of the shell is very variable from species to species, and may reflect the animal’s diet.[4] The iridescent nacre that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white, to pink, red and green-red, through to Haliotis iris, which shows predominantly deep blues, greens and purples. The animal shows fimbriated[disambiguation needed] head-lobes. The side-lobes are fimbriated and cirrated. The rounded foot is very large. The radula has small median teeth, and the lateral teeth are single and beam-like. There are about 70 uncini, with denticulated hooks, the first four very large.
