    <h3><a href="closeseasonformoifishing.html">Close season for Moi Fishing</a></h3>
        <p> ”  Close season for Moi Fishing – While Westernization ended the prohibition on moi, access to the fish was limited due to depletion of the wild stock. Stock-enhancement programs through the 1990s rebuilt the sport fishery for moi; commercial fishing is still virtually nonexistent. However, more people in Hawaii and on the mainland are enjoying this fish today, thanks to aquaculture operations. Hawaii’s Oceanic Institute provides the stock for moi farmers throughout the state who market the fish at sizes of 3/4 to 1 1/2 pounds </p>
