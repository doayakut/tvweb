        <p>   Record Lingcod Caught. The lingcod likely got the name ling from early settlers who related it to European lings but acknowledged its white flaky flesh by adding cod.  Cultus cod was the name used most often in the early 1900s — an insult to this fine fish, as cultus means “of little worth” in Chinook. Lingcod ranges from Baja California to Kodiak Island and the Aleutian Peninsula </p>
