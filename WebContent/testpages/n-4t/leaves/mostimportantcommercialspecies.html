    <h3><a href="mostimportantcommercialspecies.html">most important commercial species</a></h3>
        <p>  The  most important commercial species are the Pacific ocean perch and the widow, canary, chilipepper, yelloweye, vermillion and thornyhead rockfish. The fish can range in size from 1 to 40 pounds, but 2 to 5 pounds is most common. Rockfish are caught by trolling, trawling, longlining, jigging, trapping and gillnetting â€” either targeted or as bycatch. Rockfish are extremely slow growing, making them susceptible to overfishing </p>
