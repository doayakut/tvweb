        <p> The  <a href="leaves/slenderkingklip.html">slender kingklip,</a> a member of the cusk eel family, comprises four species: red (G. chilensis), golden (G. blacodes), South African (G. capensis) and black (G. maculatus). Depending on the species, kingklip can reach 5 to 6 feet long and 50 pounds, but most found on the market average 10 pounds. Kingklip are found in waters as deep as 250 fathoms off South Africa, New Zealand and Australia as well as off the coasts of Argentina and Chile. They are caught mostly by trawlers, often as a bycatch, and by hook and line.  <a href="leaves/ineuropekingklipismarketedascuskeel.html">In Europe, kingklip is marketed as cusk eel</a>. In New Zealand it is called ling, and in South America, congrio (cusk eel). Golden, red and black kingklip are marketed internationally, but the U.S. market prefers golden and red.
 </p>
        <p> Red is considered best of the kingklips for flavor and texture.  <a href="leaves/rawmeatofredandgoldenkingklip.html">Raw meat of red and golden kingklip</a> is creamy white, sometimes with a yellowish tinge. It cooks up white. Black kingklip has darker meat that also cooks up darker.  <a href="leaves/blackkingklipfillets.html">Black kingklip fillets</a> are also narrower than red and golden fillets. The flavor is mild and slightly sweet. The texture is dense but tender with a good, large flake. Black kingklip is not as tender as the other two. A traditional seafood in South America, kingklip is the  <a href="leaves/mainingredientincaldillocongrio.html">main ingredient in caldillo congrio,</a> a spicy, Chilean-style bouillabaisse. The fish works well in soup and stews, because the dense meat holds together. The meat’s density also means that it takes longer to cook than other types of whitefish. Fillets, which range from 1 to 4 pounds, lend themselves to almost any cooking method.

        <p> Genypterus capensis (Smith, 1847), commonly known as Kingklip, is a species of cusk eel occurring along the Southern African coast from Walvis Bay in Namibia to Algoa Bay in South Africa, and is closely related to Genypterus blacodes from New Zealand. The species grows to a maximum length of 180 cm, a weight of 15.0 kg, and is one of the most popular fish items on South African menus. Despite appearances it is not closely related to the eel family of Anguilliformes.
 </p>
        <p> Kingklip occur at depths from 50 – 500 m, but usually in the range 250 – 350 m. They are bottom-dwelling and inhabit rocky localities on the shelf and upper continental slope. Juveniles are more often found in shallow waters. They feed on dragonets, mantis shrimps, hake, squid, and various fish species. Spawning usually takes place from August to October. The species is oviparous, with oval pelagic eggs floating in a gelatinous mass. Their dorsal soft rays number 150, while the anal soft rays number 110. The head and body are normally pink to orange in colour, with dark blotches dorsally. Andrew Smith, the redoubtable Scots explorer and zoologist, first described the Kingklip in 1847 from a specimen caught near the entrance to Table Bay and named it Xiphiurus capensis (‘xiphos’=sword, ‘oura’=tail). His description was published in “Illustrations of the zoology of South Africa”, an account of the natural history objects he collected during his expedition into the interior of South Africa in 1834-36. It was also described by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1858 and named Hoplophycis lalandi. [1]
 </p>
        <p> Kingklip were heavily exploited in the 1980s, and populations have not yet recovered so that some precautions are in place. Being relatively slow-growing and long-lived, stocks cannot sustain the pressure of targeted fishing, and are taken only as a bycatch species.
