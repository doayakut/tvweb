</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Groupers belong to one of the largest and  <a href="leaves/mostwidelydistributedfamiliesoffish.html">most widely distributed families of fish,</a> the sea basses. Red grouper (Epinephelus morio) is the most frequently seen grouper in the marketplace and is valued for its availability, flavor and size. Because of limited commercial supplies of the true black grouper (Mycteroperca spp.), it has largely been replaced by the gag (M. micro-lepis), which offers similar edibility and value. Some processors call gag “the grouper of choice,” since it offers better yield and firmer meat. It is referred to in the market as black grouper. Market size for black grouper is around 20 pounds, and red grouper is marketed at anywhere from 5 to 15 pounds.  <a href="leaves/groupersarefoundintemperatewaters.html">Groupers are found in temperate waters</a> from the Mid-Atlantic states and Florida to South America, Central America and the Gulf of Mexico. Groupers are typically caught by hook and line.
 </p>
        <p> Groupers have a mild but distinct flavor, somewhere between bass and halibut.  <a href="leaves/thetaste.html">The taste</a> of most groupers is similar, with slight differences in flavor and texture, depending on size, species and location of harvest. Red grouper is sweeter and milder than black grouper, and many consider reds the better of the two. Once the skin is removed from the fish, it’s hard to tell red and black grouper apart, but black grouper does have firmer meat in the fresh state.  <a href="leaves/therawmeat.html">The raw meat</a> of both is white and lean with a notable lack of bones. Cooked, the white meat  has a very firm texture and heavy flake and remains moist. In the South,  <a href="leaves/blackenedgrouperisafavoritepreparation.html">blackened grouper is a favorite preparation,</a> but this versatile fish can be fried, grilled, skewered or used in chowders and soups. Larger whole grouper can be roasted, and large fillets should be butterflied before grilling because of their thickness. Grouper is very forgiving; it can be overcooked and still remain moist.

        <p> Groupers are teleosts, typically having a stout body and a large mouth. They are not built for long-distance, fast swimming. They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon, though obviously in such a large group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Some species prefer to ambush their prey, while other species are active predators. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.[6]
 </p>
        <p> Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out of a cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in. Some research indicates roving coralgroupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus) sometimes cooperate with giant morays in hunting.[7]
 </p>
        <p> Groupers are mostly monandric protogynous hermaphrodites, i.e. they mature only as females and have the ability to change sex after sexual maturity.[8][9] Some species of groupers grow about a kilogram per year and are generally adolescent until they reach three kilograms, when they become female. The largest males often control harems containing three to 15 females.[8][10] Groupers often pair spawn, which enables large males to competitively exclude smaller males from reproducing.
