    <h3><a href="supportusb3.html">support USB 3</a></h3>
        <p>  It's also the first camera to  support USB 3.0 -- I'm not quite sure of the implications yet, as that depends on implementation, but it does open the door for faster download speeds to the computer and improved bandwidth for tethered shooting. The new navigation buttons are cleverly designed for moving diagonally (as you'd want to do when selecting focus points), and I think I like Pentax's approach better than Nikon's or Canon's controls.
