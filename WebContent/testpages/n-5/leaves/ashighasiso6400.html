    <h3><a href="ashighasiso6400.html">as high as ISO 6400</a></h3>
        <p>  Shots  as high as ISO 6400 remain pretty usable at full size as well, depending upon image content. But I really wish the company hadn't felt compelled to invoke expanded ISO sensitivity range marketing voodoo on the high end (I have no problem with it for ISO 100). Before I realized that the expanded range option simply wasn't appearing because I shoot raw+JPEG -- it's not available with raw -- I thought "Wow. A camera that actually produces usable shots across it's entire ISO sensitivity range </p>
