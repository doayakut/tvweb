    <h3><a href="asubstantialgrip.html">a substantial grip</a></h3>
        <p>  Only the Sony NEX models offer  a substantial grip, and I think that's a large factor in their popularity. Finally, because they're smaller and tend to be targeted at folks stepping up from point-and-shoots, we all expect at least the entry-level models to be cheaper than they are -- not the typical $500-plus at launch. Sony's Alpha ILCE-3000 (aka the Sony A3000) attempts to jump all these hurdles at once by stuffing one of  its NEX cameras into a dSLR body and pricing it aggressively at $400 for the kit.
