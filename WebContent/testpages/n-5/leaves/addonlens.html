        <p>  Because of the way they look and physically attach to your smartphone, it would be easy to mistake them for some sort of  add-on lens that works with your smartphone's built-in camera, magically combining all the strengths of its shooter with the power of a zoom lens. There is no magic here, though, and perhaps that's what's most disappointing about the QX10.
