        <p> When scrutinized, the images from the  D7100 look sharper than the D5200's, and the extra bit of sharpness helps compensate for noise as the ISO sensitivity rises. That said, nothing about the D7100's photos noticeably outclasses those of the D5200; they're similarly good. Despite using the same metering systems, they seem to have slightly different settings, though, as the D7100's matrix-metered exposures appear a 2/3-stop brighter in our lab tests -- that's better -- than those of the D5200. And it does not seem to have the same focus issue in our lab tests that the D7000 did </p>
