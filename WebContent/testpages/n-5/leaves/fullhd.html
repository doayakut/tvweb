    <h3><a href="fullhd.html">full HD</a></h3>
        <p>  The resolution is 1,440x1,080p at 30 frames per second, so it's not technically " full HD." It is fine for online sharing and viewing on mobile devices and, as with pictures, video benefits from having the optical image stabilization. If recording in full HD matters to you, you'll have to get one of Sony's other Cyber-shots, but even then you'll be recording in AVCHD (MTS) and not MP4. The Sony Cyber-shot QX10 makes a bit more sense that its linemate, the QX100 </p>
