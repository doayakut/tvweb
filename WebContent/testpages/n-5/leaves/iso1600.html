    <h3><a href="iso1600.html">ISO 1600</a></h3>
        <p>  JPEGs look clean up through ISO 800, which is typical for this class, and usable at full scale to about  ISO 1600 and ISO 6400 at smaller magnifications. While a 13x19 print of an ISO 1600 photo wasn't quite as clean or sharp as I would have liked, it doesn't look that bad, but that's still not as good as the T5i.
