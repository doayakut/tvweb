    <h3><a href="sltcamerasarentslrs.html">SLT cameras arent SLRs</a></h3>
        <p>  Because it's got to go somewhere on the web site, Sony buries it in the middle of the SLR page, which itself is misleading because the  SLT cameras aren't SLRs. The thing is, people upgrade from a point-and-shoot for two main reasons: better photo quality and better performance. The A3000 succeeds on the first but not on the second. For the most part, the ability to change lenses tends to be an ancillary desire -- most people stick with the lens bundled with the camera </p>
