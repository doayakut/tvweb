    <h3><a href="detailintherawfiles.html">detail in the raw files</a></h3>
        <p> The camera clips a little more in the highlights than I like, and there isn't a lot of recoverable  detail in the raw files on bright areas. I did have some luck reclaiming detail in clipped areas of bright, saturated reds, however, as well as bringing up dark shadow areas. Olympus defaults to a Natural color preset that still pushes the saturation a little more than I like, but color accuracy in raw files looks good. Automatic white balance is slightly cool but acceptable </p>
