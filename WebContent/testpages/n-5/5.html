    <h3><a href="5.html">Nikon Coolpix L820
</a></h3>

        <p> Considering its street price of less than $200, the Nikon Coolpix L820 boasts an  <a href="leaves/attractivesetofspecs.html">attractive set of specs</a>. The star is obviously the 30x zoom lens, which starts at an ultrawide-angle 22.5mm and zooms out to 675mm. That covers a lot of ground and gives you great framing flexibility. Along with that you get a 16-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor (something typically found in higher-end point-and-shoots) and a high-resolution 3-inch LCD. And, it's powered by four AA-size batteries, which is becoming increasingly rare.
 </p>
        <p> It is, however, still an entry-level point-and-shoot and performs like one. Yes, you can get some pretty nice pictures and movies out of it. And yes, it's not painfully slow to use, like cameras in this class used to be ( <a href="leaves/itspredecessorthel810.html">its predecessor, the L810</a> is downright sluggish by comparison). But it's not great in low light and indoors without a flash, it can be slow to focus with the lens extended, and shooting performance in general is best suited for slow-moving or stationary subjects.  <a href="leaves/aabatterypoweredcameras.html">AA-battery-powered cameras</a> tend to be slower performers than cameras that use rechargeable lithium ion battery packs. The L820, however, is reasonably fast. From off to first shot is 1.5 seconds. The time from pressing the shutter release to capture without prefocusing is just over 0.1 second in bright lighting and 0.5 second in low lighting. Shot-to-shot times averaged 1.2 seconds. The time between shots when using the flash is nearly as good at 1.3 seconds, which is remarkably fast.
 </p>
        <p> There are some positives to being entry-level, though, so if you think you can live with its drawbacks, it's worth a spot on your list of cameras to consider.As with most entry-level point-and-shoots, you'll want to give the L820 as much light as possible. Photos are best at and below ISO 200. As the sensitivity increases, so do the noise and smeary details from noise reduction. Also, colors appear slightly washed-out and muddy from  <a href="leaves/noiseatiso800.html">noise at ISO 800</a> and above. Video quality is good enough for Web use and nondiscriminating TV viewing. If you plan to do a lot of panning from side to side or shooting fast-moving subjects, you'll likely see judder and ghosting, but not enough to make clips unwatchable. The zoom does work when recording, but you may hear it moving in quieter scenes. If you use the zoom while recording you'll want to keep the autofocus set to full-time, but you might hear the lens focusing in very quiet scenes as well.
 </p>
        <p> The thing to keep in mind is that with this zoom lens the maximum aperture gets smaller as you zoom in. This means the camera has to use either slower shutter speeds, higher ISO sensitivities, or both in order to get a good exposure.  <a href="leaves/slowershutterspeeds.html">Slower shutter speeds</a> can result in blurry pictures and higher ISOs, again, increasing noise and softness. Basically, you'll want to make sure you have a lot of light if you want sharp photos while using the zoom lens. (This is the case with most megazooms, by the way, not only the L820.)
