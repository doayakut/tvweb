    <h3><a href="4.html">Canon PowerShot G16
</a></h3>

        <p> As a news announcement, Canon's PowerShot G16 enthusiast compact was a bit of a yawner: basically, it gains Wi-Fi and 1080/60p video over its predecessor, the G15.  <a href="leaves/canonsawesomelypowerfulcompactcameras.html">Canon's awesomely powerful compact cameras</a>. As a camera, though, the G series is slowly improving. Given that it was once one of the cameras that defined the enthusiast category it's sad to see it slip compared with competitors. Like the G15, the G16 has excellent image quality at  <a href="leaves/lowisosensitivities.html">low ISO sensitivities,</a> but its performance is significantly improved -- still not the fastest option in its class, but no longer the slug it was. Its feature set continues to lag comparatively, but overall the camera remains a nice option for manual-control devotees who don't want to schlep around a dSLR and who still find compact interchangeable-lens cameras a bit too large.
 </p>
        <p> The  <a href="leaves/g16sphotoquality.html">G16's photo quality</a> is about the same as the G15's, though looking back at that review I think it might have gained an extra stop of usability through tweaks in the JPEG processing. While very good for a small-sensor camera, photo quality still doesn't quite match that of the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100. For JPEGs, images look good up through ISO 400, then  <a href="leaves/artifacts.html">artifacts</a> begin to become quite apparent. While there's no great dynamic range or unsuppressed noise in the raw files, with some adjustments you can produce shots as high as ISO 1600 by processing them to better handle the tradeoffs of noise and sharpness. That said, I couldn't get decent prints out of my ISO 1600 shots.
 </p>
        <p> It does have  <a href="leaves/thesameexcellentlens.html">the same excellent lens</a> as the G15, fast, bright, and reasonably sharp, albeit with some barrel distortion even at the 50mm-equivalent focal length. At its widest the lens stops down to f2.8 at about 96mm-equivalent, which is more than acceptable. The flip side, however, is that it can't narrow to more than f8, which had me enabling the ND filter more than usual in bright light. Like many competitors, the G15 clips highlights, though you can tweak your settings for more optimal exposures. The color rendering is pretty good, though daylight white balance is a little cool and the images a little contrasty. Unfortunately, it still doesn't offer an AdobeRGB setting, nor are there dynamic range correction and color controls when shooting in raw or raw+JPEG.
 </p>
        <p> As advertised, the G16 is faster than the G15 in many, but not all, ways. It's faster on startup, taking 1.6 seconds to power on, focus, and shoot. But my test results show its shot lag -- the time needed to focus and shoot -- is slower. It's pretty fast in good light at 0.3 second, but in dim light rose from 0.6 second to 0.9 second. The rest looks significantly better, and in line with Canon's claims of about 50 percent improvement. Time between two JPEG shots runs about 0.7 second, but two sequential raw shots runs 1.4 seconds; time between JPEGs with flash enabled rises to about 2.9 seconds. While these times are a welcome  <a href="leaves/improvementovertheg15.html">improvement over the G15,</a> they're still pretty slow. One of the most noticeable performance bumps comes in continuous shooting, just about 10 frames per second with fixed focus and a still-respectable 5.8fps with continous autofocus. The optical viewfinder, while small, still works effectively in burst situations, with surprisingly accurate framing. However, I did experience the odd drift in continuous autofocus that you see in the three shots above -- it didn't just miss and lock on something else, it would simply stop focusing for a few shots, then drift back in, then out again, in a pretty easy situation. And the continued drawback of the direct-view optical viewfinder is that there's no AF overlay so you're pretty much just pointin' and prayin'.
