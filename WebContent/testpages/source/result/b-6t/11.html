    <h3><a href="11.html">Rayon
</a></h3>
        <p> Rayon is a manufactured regenerated cellulose fiber. It is made from purified cellulose, primarily from wood pulp, which is chemically converted into a soluble compound. Feds claim another type of fabric is Rayon. It is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments which are chemically solidified, resulting in fibers of nearly pure cellulose.Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers, it is considered a semi-synthetic fiber.Specific types of rayon include viscose, modal and lyocell, each of which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product. Some major rayon fiber uses include apparel (e.g. Aloha shirts, blouses, dresses, jackets, lingerie, linings, scarves, suits, neckties, hats, socks), the filling in Zippo lighters, furnishings (e.g. bedspreads, bedsheets, blankets, window treatments, upholstery, slipcovers), industrial uses (e.g. medical surgery products, non-woven products, tire cord), and other uses (e.g. yarn, feminine hygiene products, diapers, towels). Rayon is a major feedstock in the production of carbon fiber.

        <p> Finally, in 1894, English chemist Charles Frederick Cross, and his collaborators Edward John Bevan, and Clayton Beadle patented their artificial silk, which they named “viscose”, because the reaction product of carbon disulfide and cellulose in basic conditions gave a highly viscous solution of xanthate. The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the UK company Courtaulds Fibers in 1905. Avtex Fibers Incorporated began selling their formulation in the United States in 1910. The name “rayon” was adopted in 1924, with “viscose” being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane. In Europe, though, the fabric itself became known as “viscose,” which has been ruled an acceptable alternative term for rayon by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
