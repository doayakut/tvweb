    <h3><a href="7.html">Burlap
</a></h3>
        <p> Burlap or Hessian, a dense woven fabric, has been historically produced as a coarse fabric, but more recently it is being used in a refined state known simply as jute as an eco-friendly material for bags, rugs, and other products. The name “burlap” appears to be of unknown origin.The name “hessian” is attributed to the use of the fabric, initially, as part of the uniform of soldiers from the German state of Hessewho were called “Hessians”.  It is breathable and thus resists condensation and associated spoilage of the contents. It is also durable enough to withstand rough handling in transit; these properties have also led to its use for temporary protection as wet covering to prevent rapid moisture loss in setting of cement and concrete by the construction industry. Hessian is also commonly used for making sandbags, empty hessian sacks that, when filled with sand, are used for flood mitigation when building temporary embankments against floodwaters or field fortifications.Hessian is often used to make sacks and bags to ship goods like coffee beans; these can be described as gunny sacks.

        <p> Due to its coarse texture, it is not commonly used in modern apparel. However, this roughness gave it a use in a religious context for mortification of the flesh, where individuals may wear an abrasive shirt called a cilice or “hair shirt” and in the wearing of “sackcloth” on Ash Wednesday. Owing to its durability, open weave, naturally non-shiny refraction, and fuzzy texture, Ghillie suits for 3D camouflage are often made of hessian. It was also a popular material for camouflage scrim on combat helmets of World War II. Until the advent of the plastic “leafy” multi-color net system following the Vietnam War, burlap scrim was also woven onto shrimp and fish netting to create large-scale military camouflage netting.
