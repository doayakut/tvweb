<h1> Types of Fabric

    <h3><a href="13.html">Denim
</a></h3>
        <p> Denim is a rugged cotton twill textile, in which the weft passes under two (twi- “double”) or more warp threads. This twill weaving produces the familiar diagonal ribbing of the fabric, which distinguishes denim from cotton duck. It is characteristic of any indigo denim that only the warp threads are dyed, whereas the weft threads remain plain white. As a result of the warp-faced twill weaving, one side of the fabric shows the blue warp threads, the other side shows the white weft threads. This is why jeans are white on the inside and what makes denim’s fading characteristics unique compared to every other fabric. Dry or raw denim, as opposed to washed denim, is a denim fabric that is not washed after being dyed during its production. Over time, denim will generally fade, which is often considered desirable. During the process of wear, it is typical to see fading on areas that generally receive the most stress, which includes the upper thighs (whiskers), the ankles (stacks) and behind the knees (honey combs).

        <p> After being crafted into an article of clothing, most denim is washed to make it softer and to reduce or eliminate shrinkage, which could cause an item to not fit after the owner washes it. In addition to being washed, non-dry denim is sometimes artificially “distressed” to produce a worn look. Much of the appeal of factory distressed denim is that it looks similar to dry denim that has, with time, faded. With dry denim, however, such fading is affected by the body of the person who wears the jeans and the activities of his/her daily life. This creates what many enthusiasts feel to be a more natural, unique look than distressed denim. To facilitate the natural distressing process, some wearers of dry denim will often abstain from washing their jeans for more than six months, though it is not a necessity for fading. “Selvage denim” refers to a unique type of closed selvage (derived from the Latin Salvare, meaning “to secure, to make safe”) that is created using one continuous cross yarn (the weft) that is passed back and forth through the vertical warp beams.

        <p> All fabric has a selvedge (a portmanteau derived from the joining of “self” & “edge”), this is the natural edge of the cloth and contrary to some sources does not unravel or fray regardless of which weaving method or machinery is used.

        <p> “Selvage denim” refers to a unique type of closed selvage (derived from the Latin Salvare, meaning “to secure, to make safe”) that is created using one continuous cross yarn (the weft) that is passed back and forth through the vertical warp beams. This is traditionally finished at both edge with a contrast warp, most commonly red which is why sometimes this type of denim is referred to as “Red Selvage”. This process is only possible using a Shuttle loom. Shuttle looms weave a narrower 30 inch fabric, which is on average half the width of the more modern shuttleless Sulzer looms (invented in 1927 by the Sulzer brothers) and thus a longer piece of fabric is required to make a pair of jeans (approximately 3 yards).[citation needed] To maximize yield, jean were traditionally made with a straight outseam that utilised the full width of the fabric including this edge. This became not only desirable but since the production of wider width denim, a mark of premium quality as when worn with a turn up the two selvages where visible rather than an unattractive overlocked edge.
