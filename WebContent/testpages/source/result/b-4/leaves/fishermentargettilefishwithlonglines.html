    <h3><a href="fishermentargettilefishwithlonglines.html">Fishermen target tilefish with longlines</a></h3>
        <p>   Fishermen target tilefish with longlines; it is a selective fishery with little bycatch. Whether from Miami or Montauk, almost  all tilefish is sold fresh, graded and priced by size: The bigger the fish, the higher the per-pound price. But just because smaller tilefish are less expensive than large ones, that doesn’t mean you’ve got a bargain. The smaller fish have a shorter shelf life, and their flesh tends to be softer </p>
