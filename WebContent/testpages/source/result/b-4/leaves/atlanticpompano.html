    <h3><a href="atlanticpompano.html">Atlantic pompano</a></h3>
        <p> Gourmands describe the  Atlantic pompano as “the world’s most edible fish.” The flat-bodied, pan-sized pompano is easy to eat whole, a form that shows off the beautiful, silvery skin. The species is harvested from Virginia to Texas, but primarily off Florida’s west coast. Commercial landings are limited, and as a result, prices remain high in most markets </p>
