    <h3><a href="1.html">Fujifilm X-M1
</a></h3>
        <p> Fujifilm brings its interchangeable-lens camera line down another price notch with the addition of the X-M1. It's essentially a cheaper version of the X-E1, which swaps the viewfinder for a host of other features. The Fujifil X-M1 was recently used to shoot a movie. The X-M1 is based around the same sensor as the X-E1, probably the new model's most notable feature compared with competitors. While the X-E1 has an electronic viewfinder and mic input, plus sports a far more retro design, in trade-off the much cheaper X-M1 has a larger, higher-resolution LCD, built-in Wi-Fi for image transfer, and an updated EXR Processor II from the X100S.

        <p> I tested both the X-M1 and X-E1 more or less simultaneously, which turned out to be a mixed blessing. While I have no qualms about the photo quality, which is excellent and seems like a steal in the cheaper X-M1, I kept wishing for a camera that combined the best of both models: the body and kit lens of the X-E1 with the better, tilting LCD of the X-M1. The X-M1's Wi-Fi connectivity is also a nice option, but the current (albeit fixable) implementation leaves quite a bit to be desired. For what it's worth, the X-M1 displays the best photo quality I've seen thus far in a sub-$1,000 camera kit. Thanks to Fujifilm's X-Trans sensor and excellent image processing, even the JPEG photos are not just usable, but really good up through ISO 1600. Shots as high as ISO 6400 remain pretty usable at full size as well, depending upon image content. But I really wish the company hadn't felt compelled to invoke expanded ISO sensitivity range marketing voodoo on the high end (I have no problem with it for ISO 100). Before I realized that the expanded range option simply wasn't appearing because I shoot raw+JPEG -- it's not available with raw -- I thought "Wow. A camera that actually produces usable shots across it's entire ISO sensitivity range." Then I realized my error and found the useless upper ranges.
