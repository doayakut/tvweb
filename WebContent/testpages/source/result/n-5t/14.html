</a></h3>
        <p> Despite being one of the few growing segments of the digital camera market, mirrorless versions of interchangeable-lens cameras still don't get no respect. For one, there's a perception in some quarters that they don't produce the same image quality as dSLRs, even though they're nearly identical in all the ways that affect image quality. I also think there's a grip issue; for the most part, ILCs tend to sacrifice a decent grip for compactness and sleek design. Only the Sony NEX models offer a substantial grip, and I think that's a large factor in their popularity. Finally, because they're smaller and tend to be targeted at folks stepping up from point-and-shoots, we all expect at least the entry-level models to be cheaper than they are -- not the typical $500-plus at launch. Sony's Alpha ILCE-3000 (aka the Sony A3000) attempts to jump all these hurdles at once by stuffing one of its NEX cameras into a dSLR body and pricing it aggressively at $400 for the kit.
 </p>
        <p> Rather than shrinking one of its single-lens translucent (SLT) models the way Canon compressed a dSLR for the SL1 -- which likely would have resulted in a more expensive model -- Sony based a mirrorless dSLR-style body around its E-Mount lenses and NEX menu and control system. Overall, the idea makes a lot of sense. Once you drop the mirror, the biggest constraint to shrinkage becomes the lens mount. And on the surface (though not necessarily in practice), the NEX menu system looks a lot friendlier for the presumably novice buyer of this camera. It's telling that the closest price competitors for the A3000, like the Canon T3, are generally about two years old.
 </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, the result is a really confusing camera. Because it's got to go somewhere on the web site, Sony buries it in the middle of the SLR page, which itself is misleading because the SLT cameras aren't SLRs. The thing is, people upgrade from a point-and-shoot for two main reasons: better photo quality and better performance. The A3000 succeeds on the first but not on the second. For the most part, the ability to change lenses tends to be an ancillary desire -- most people stick with the lens bundled with the camera. Unlike petite dSLRs like the Canon SL1, Sony's use of the E-Mount system means smaller lenses, compared to the full-size EF-S lenses.
 </p>
        <p> The tonal range is pretty typical for an entry-level APS-C model, in that it clips highlights and doesn't preserve much detail to bring out, but it can recover shadow detail without adding a lot of noise. Colors are saturated and contrasty, with some hue shifts in the reds, but they're pleasing nonetheless. There's no neutral color profile option; you can tweak the existing presets but not save as a new one. I think my biggest issue with the A3000's design is that it's just boring. It's not particularly attractive or streamlined for shooting, and the meh viewfinder and fixed, low-quality LCD made photographing feel more like a chore than I've experienced with recent cameras. Factoring in the mediocre performance, and it's a tough sell. The NEX-3N is available for only $50 more in places and it's a lot more compact with a better LCD. The Nikon D3200 kit can be found for as low as $550 and delivers comparable photo quality, a better LCD, optical viewfinder and much better performance. Sony's HX300 is similarly priced and has a better viewfinder, LCD, performance and a fixed zoom lens that would provide more flexibility for the typical buyer of the A3000 who probably won't buy additional lenses. It can't match the photo quality, though.
