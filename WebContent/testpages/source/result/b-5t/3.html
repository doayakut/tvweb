    <h3><a href="3.html">Nikon Coolpix L820
</a></h3>
        <p> Considering its street price of less than $200, the Nikon Coolpix L820 boasts an attractive set of specs. The star is obviously the 30x zoom lens, which starts at an ultrawide-angle 22.5mm and zooms out to 675mm. That covers a lot of ground and gives you great framing flexibility. Along with that you get a 16-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor (something typically found in higher-end point-and-shoots) and a high-resolution 3-inch LCD. And, it's powered by four AA-size batteries, which is becoming increasingly rare.
 </p>
        <p> It is, however, still an entry-level point-and-shoot and performs like one. Yes, you can get some pretty nice pictures and movies out of it. And yes, it's not painfully slow to use, like cameras in this class used to be (its predecessor, the L810 is downright sluggish by comparison). But it's not great in low light and indoors without a flash, it can be slow to focus with the lens extended, and shooting performance in general is best suited for slow-moving or stationary subjects. AA-battery-powered cameras tend to be slower performers than cameras that use rechargeable lithium ion battery packs. The L820, however, is reasonably fast. From off to first shot is 1.5 seconds. The time from pressing the shutter release to capture without prefocusing is just over 0.1 second in bright lighting and 0.5 second in low lighting. Shot-to-shot times averaged 1.2 seconds. The time between shots when using the flash is nearly as good at 1.3 seconds, which is remarkably fast.
