    <h3><a href="0.html">Fujifilm FinePix F900EXR
</a></h3>
        <p> Fujifilm's FinePix point-and-shoots have taken a backseat to its enthusiast compact models like the X20. Still, there are a handful of its FinePix models that deserve attention -- by hobbyists or more-casual snapshooters -- such as the 42x zoom HS50EXR and its pocketable sibling, the 20x zoom F900EXR. The F900EXR is great as a leave-it-in-auto compact camera. However, while it doesn't have the larger sensors or fast lenses of Fujifilm's X-series cameras, it does have some things that enthusiasts will appreciate, such as manual and semimanual shooting modes, raw capture, and quick access to important settings. It's a fast camera and takes excellent pictures, too, though to get the best results from it, you'll need to explore its various modes and settings. And yes, it has built-in Wi-Fi, so as long as you have a mobile-broadband-connected iOS or Android smartphone or tablet, you'll be able to shoot and share your shots from anywhere.
 </p>
        <p> From a photo quality standpoint, the F900EXR can produce some of the best photos you'll get from a camera in this class. The overall quality -- especially at higher ISOs -- doesn't compare with what you get from cameras with larger sensors like dSLRs, but for a small-sensor compact megazoom, it's quite good. When viewed at full size, its 16-megapixel pictures are on the soft side with visible artifacts right down to its lowest ISO setting -- not great for enlarging and heavily cropping. (That can be said for almost all cameras in this class, though.)
