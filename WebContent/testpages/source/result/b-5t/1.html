        <p> There's so much to like about the eagerly awaited replacement for the Canon EOS 60D, the 70D. It comes with a completely overhauled, Live View/video-optimized autofocus system that doesn't require special lenses; a more streamlined body design with an articulated touch screen; and Wi-Fi support. And with only a couple of exceptions, I like the 70D and enjoy shooting with it; it's fast and fluid. However, pixel peepers will likely be disappointed with the still photo quality, which really should be better for the money.

        <p> The image quality didn't change noticeably between my preproduction tests and my final tests, but my opinion has. It's...fine. Not outstanding for the money, but not bad, either. However, it's simply not as good as the Nikon D7100. Yes, it's still an advance over its predecessor 60D, but not enormously -- I don't think you even gain a full stop of usability, and any advantages seem to stem from the slight increase in resolution. It's a bit better than the Rebel T5i across the entire sensitivity range, though you really have to scrutinize them. (The T5i looks better starting at ISO 1600, but that seems to be because the T5i meters a third of a stop brighter.) Great Deal on Canon EOS 70D.
