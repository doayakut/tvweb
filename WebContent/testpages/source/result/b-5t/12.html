</a></h3>
        <p> The Kodak EasyShare Z5010 is a good example of what Kodak did best with its digital cameras. Instead of going after the entire market, Kodak concentrated on making cameras that were easy to use and a good value, and that's the Z5010 all over. Kodak EasyShare Z5010 best features. It's a basic point-and-shoot, but still has a manual mode for shutter speed and aperture control, with a 21x zoom lens, a 3-inch LCD, and AA batteries for power. It also has Kodak's Share button, which lets you easily tag photos and video clips for quick uploading to sharing sites, e-mailing, or sending to Kodak's Pulse picture frames when the camera's connected to a computer.

        <p> However, the Z5010's photos are just a step above what you'd get from a good smartphone and its shooting performance is fairly slow -- both typical for this class of camera. And the Z5010 feels like an entry-level camera, too. Then again, you do get a nice wide and long lens and it's priced to move; you can find it for about $100 less than its original $199.95 price. The Kodak EasyShare Z5010 is capable of taking some very good photos, but it is not without limitations. Basically, if you view its 14-megapixel pictures at larger sizes, 80 to 100 percent, you'll see a good deal of noise and artifacts, and subjects look soft and lack fine detail. That's even at its lowest sensitivity of ISO 64. This is only really a problem if you frequently enlarge and heavily crop your photos or are making prints larger than 8x10. At smaller screen and print sizes, photos taken with plenty of light look good.
