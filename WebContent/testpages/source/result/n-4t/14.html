    <h3><a href="14.html">Moi
</a></h3>
        <p> Historically, in Hawaii moi was a delicacy reserved for male royalty; commoners caught eating the fish faced severe punishment. Hence moi’s unofficial title as “the fish of kings.” Close season for Moi Fishing – While Westernization ended the prohibition on moi, access to the fish was limited due to depletion of the wild stock. Stock-enhancement programs through the 1990s rebuilt the sport fishery for moi; commercial fishing is still virtually nonexistent. However, more people in Hawaii and on the mainland are enjoying this fish today, thanks to aquaculture operations. Hawaii’s Oceanic Institute provides the stock for moi farmers throughout the state who market the fish at sizes of 3/4 to 1 1/2 pounds. The primary aquaculture operation in Hawaii raises moi in open-ocean, submerged cages. Smaller-scale farmers use seawater tanks, raceways or ponds for raising the fish. Farmed moi are harvested, iced and delivered within hours to domestic (Hawaii and mainland United States) and international markets.

        <p> Moi flesh is white to light gray and cooks up white. The rich, mild-flavored meat is moist, tender and flaky. Moi has a relatively high oil content that keeps the meat moist in a variety of preparation methods. Steam or bake whole fish or sear fillets, skin-side down, in a pan. Moi can also be grilled, broiled or pan fried and served raw as sashimi. The oil in the flesh makes smoking an option as well. As a farmed fish, moi offers consistent quality, size and year-round availability. Supplies are limited but will increase as fledgling farming operations boost production and value-added products are developed. The rich, mild-flavored meat is moist, tender and flaky.

        <p> Threadfins are silvery grey perciform marine fish of the family Polynemidae. Found in tropical to subtropical waters throughout the world, the threadfin family contains nine genera and 33 species. An unrelated species sometimes known by the name threadfin, Alectis indicus, is properly the Indian threadfish (family Carangidae). Ranging in length from 20 centimeters (7.9 in) in the black-finned threadfin (Polydactylus nigripinnis) to 200 centimeters (79 in) in fourfinger threadfins (Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), threadfins are both important to commercial fisheries as a food fish, and popular among anglers. Their habit of forming large schools makes the threadfins a reliable and economic catch.

        <p> Their bodies are elongate and fusiform, with spinous and soft dorsal fins widely separate. Their tail fins are large and deeply forked; indicating speed and agility. The mouth is large and inferior; a blunt snout projects far ahead. The jaws and palate possess bands of villiform (fibrous) teeth. Their most distinguishing feature is their pectoral fins: they are composed of two distinct sections, the lower of which consists of between 3-7 long, thread-like independent rays. In Polynemus species there may be up to 15 of these modified rays.
 </p>
        <p> In some species, such as the royal threadfin (Pentanemus quinquarius), the thread-like rays may extend well past the tail fin. This feature explains both the common name threadfin and the family name Polynemidae, from the Greek poly meaning “many” and nema meaning “filament.” Similar species, such as the mullets (family Mugilidae) and milkfish (family Chanidae) can be easily distinguished from threadfins by their lack of filamentous pectoral rays.
