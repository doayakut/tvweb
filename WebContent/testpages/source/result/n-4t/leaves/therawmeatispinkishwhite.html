    <h3><a href="therawmeatispinkishwhite.html">The raw meat is pinkishwhite</a></h3>
        <p>   The raw meat is pinkish-white but cooks up white with a firm, flaky texture. The flavor is mild but distinctive, often compared to lobster or crab, which is not surprising, since the tilefishâ€™s diet is largely crustaceans. Because tilefish contain high levels of methylmercury, the FDA advises pregnant and nursing women, women of childbearing age and young children to avoid eating tilefish meat.
