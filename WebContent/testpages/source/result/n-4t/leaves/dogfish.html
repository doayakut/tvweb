        <p>  Promoters hope to find greater acceptance for the  dogfish by marketing it under a Food-and-Drug-Administration-approved alternative name: “Cape shark.” Domestically, the species is found along the Pacific Coast from the Gulf of Alaska to Point Conception, California. On the Atlantic Coast, it roams between Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, and Cape Cod.  Cape shark is targeted by longliners and landed as a bycatch of gillnetters </p>
