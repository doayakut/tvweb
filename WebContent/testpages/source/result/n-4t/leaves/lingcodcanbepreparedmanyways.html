        <p> A favorite in the Pacific Northwest for upscale fish and chips,  lingcod can be prepared many ways. It works well on the grill, and large lingcod can be stuffed with vegetables and baked. Steaks and fillets are good baked with a topping such as a sun-dried tomato sauce. Steaks also may be steamed with herbs and spices </p>
