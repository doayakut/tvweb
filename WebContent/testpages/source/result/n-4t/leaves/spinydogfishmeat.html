    <h3><a href="spinydogfishmeat.html">Spiny dogfish meat</a></h3>
        <p>   Spiny dogfish meat has a sweet, mild flavor and a higher oil content than mako or other sharks.Creative cooking suggestions and preparations will increase customers’ willingness to try this versatile species. You can  deep fry spiny dogfish, as the British do for fish and chips, but don’t stop there. Use cubed meat for kebabs or in stir fries </p>
