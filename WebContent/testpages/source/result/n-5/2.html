    <h3><a href="2.html">Fujifilm FinePix F900EXR
</a></h3>
        <p> Fujifilm's FinePix point-and-shoots have taken a backseat to its enthusiast compact models like the X20. Still, there are a handful of its FinePix models that deserve attention -- by hobbyists or more-casual snapshooters -- such as the 42x zoom HS50EXR and its pocketable sibling, the 20x zoom F900EXR. The F900EXR is great as a leave-it-in-auto compact camera. However, while it doesn't have the larger sensors or fast lenses of Fujifilm's X-series cameras, it does have some things that enthusiasts will appreciate, such as manual and semimanual shooting modes, raw capture, and quick access to important settings. It's a fast camera and takes excellent pictures, too, though to get the best results from it, you'll need to explore its various modes and settings. And yes, it has built-in Wi-Fi, so as long as you have a mobile-broadband-connected iOS or Android smartphone or tablet, you'll be able to shoot and share your shots from anywhere.
 </p>
        <p> From a photo quality standpoint, the F900EXR can produce some of the best photos you'll get from a camera in this class. The overall quality -- especially at higher ISOs -- doesn't compare with what you get from cameras with larger sensors like dSLRs, but for a small-sensor compact megazoom, it's quite good. When viewed at full size, its 16-megapixel pictures are on the soft side with visible artifacts right down to its lowest ISO setting -- not great for enlarging and heavily cropping. (That can be said for almost all cameras in this class, though.)
 </p>
        <p> On the other hand, at about 50 percent, you can go up to ISO 800 and get very nice photos. And if you take advantage of all the camera can do, you can actually get good results above that sensitivity. That means doing more than setting it to Auto. You may have to adjust settings, shoot in raw, or experiment with its EXR modes to get the best results. If that's not something you're willing to do, this probably isn't a good choice. Its EXR Auto mode is very good as autoshooting modes go, but even tweaking that mode's settings can get you better shots. For more on image quality and the camera's shooting capabilities, see the slideshow above.
 </p>
        <p> Video quality is very good, and the continuous autofocus works well, though it may take a second or two to focus once the lens is fully zoomed in. If you're looking to replace a video camera with it, you may want to pass. That's mostly because full HD clips are limited to 14 minutes in length. The built-in mics did an excellent job of picking up even distant audio. However, when listening with headphones, you can hear the zoom lens movement in quieter scenes. For video, you can shoot at resolutions of 720p or 1080p at 60fps and VGA at 30fps. You also get high-speed movie movie capture at 480fps (320x112 pixels), 240fps (320x240 pixels), and 120fps (640x480 pixels). In conclusion, there are plenty of compact megazoom options available -- from basic snapshot cameras to ones that are mostly point-and-shoots with a bit of extra control to those designed for enthusiasts. The Fujiflim FinePix F900EXR falls into "enthusiast" group, but it's a very capable "family camera," with solid results if you just leave it in auto. Though its photo quality and performance still isn't that of larger-sensor cameras like dSLRs and mirrorless compacts, you're not going to get one of those with a 25-500mm zoom lens.
