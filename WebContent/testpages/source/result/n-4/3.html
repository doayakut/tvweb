    <h3><a href="3.html">Lingcod
</a></h3>
        <p> If ever there were a fish with an identity crisis, it’s the lingcod, for despite its name, this species is neither a cod nor a ling. Rather, it’s a Pacific greenling, from the family Hexagrammidae. Record Lingcod Caught. The lingcod likely got the name ling from early settlers who related it to European lings but acknowledged its white flaky flesh by adding cod.  <a href="leaves/cultuscod.html">Cultus cod</a> was the name used most often in the early 1900s — an insult to this fine fish, as cultus means “of little worth” in Chinook. Lingcod ranges from Baja California to Kodiak Island and the Aleutian Peninsula. It is a bycatch of trawl and longline fisheries, though there is a targeted fishery in Southeast Alaska. The best lingcod is landed by hook-and-line boats that bleed and ice the fish immediately after harvest. Lingcod can grow to 90 pounds but typical market size is around 10 pounds. Don’t be alarmed by the blue-green tint of the raw meat. The color cooks out completely, leaving a snow-white piece of fish.  <a href="leaves/themildtastingmeatoflingcod.html">The mild-tasting meat of Lingcod</a> is tender yet firm, with large, soft, moist flakes.

        <p> A favorite in the Pacific Northwest for upscale fish and chips,  <a href="leaves/lingcodcanbepreparedmanyways.html">lingcod can be prepared many ways</a>. It works well on the grill, and large lingcod can be stuffed with vegetables and baked. Steaks and fillets are good baked with a topping such as a sun-dried tomato sauce. Steaks also may be steamed with herbs and spices. The density of the flesh requires a longer cooking time than that of other whitefish, but be careful not to overcook the lean meat.  <a href="leaves/cheaplingcod.html">Cheap lingcod</a> usually means trawl-caught fish, inferior to hook-and-line lingcod. But if you know a quality-conscious skipper who makes short trips, you can get a good buy on trawled product.

        <p> Lingcod are unique to the west coast of North America, with the center of abundance off the coast of British Columbia. They are found on the bottom, with most individuals occupying rocky areas at depths of 10 to 100 m (32 to 328 feet). Tagging studies have shown lingcod are a largely nonmigratory species, with colonization and recruitment occurring in localized areas only.[6]Starting in October, lingcod migrate to nearshore spawning grounds. The males migrate first, and establish nest sites in strong current areas in rock crevices or on ledges. Spawning takes place between December and March, and females leave the nest site immediately after depositing eggs. Males actively defend the nest from predators until the eggs hatch in early March through late April.

        <p> The larvae are pelagic until late May or early June, when they settle to the bottom as juveniles. Initially they inhabit eel grass beds, then move to flat, sandy areas that are not the typical habitat of older lingcod. They eventually settle in habitats of similar relief and substrate as older lingcod, but remain at shallower depths for several years. Females and males mature at age three to five years (61–75 cm) and two years of age (45 cm), respectively. An adult male can be distinguished externally from a female by the presence of a small, conical papilla behind the anal vent. Up to age two, males and females grow at similar rates, with both reaching an average length of 45 cm. After age two, females grow faster than males, with the growth of males tapering off at about age eight, and females continuing to grow until about age 12 to 14. Lingcod live a maximum of about 14 years for males and 20 years for females, reaching a maximum size of approximately 90 cm and 120 cm, respectively. Off the coast of Alaska, many reach 70 pounds (32 kilograms).
