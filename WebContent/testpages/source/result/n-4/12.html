    <h3><a href="12.html">Wolffish
</a></h3>
        <p> The ferocious-looking wolffish gets its name from the sharp, protruding teeth it uses to feast on lobsters, clams and other shellfish. Found from southern New England to Greenland and the Barents Sea, the bottom-dwelling coldwater creature is primarily a bycatch of trawl fisheries targeting cod, haddock and other groundfish. Iceland, which has a directed fishery for the species, is the largest producer. Imports also come from Canada and Norway, which is developing wolffish-farming  operations. The striped wolffish is one of three Atlantic species, which also include the northern (A. denticulatus) and the spotted (A. minor) wolffish. From a culinary standpoint, there’s little difference among the three. Wolffish can reach 30 or 40 pounds, but market size averages 10 pounds.

        <p> Wolffish has long been held in high regard by European chefs, who find it an acceptable alternative to Dover sole. The lean, pearly white flesh of the wolffish has a firm texture and a mild, sweet flavor, sometimes likened to lobster. The meat has a flake similar to cod’s but not as large. Wolffish skin is edible, but since there are no scales, this species cannot be kosher. Not as firm as monkfish nor as delicate as sole, the versatile wolffish holds together well and can be cooked successfully by many methods. It’s excellent sautéed and sauced, or encrusted in herbed mustard and baked. The fish is a good addition to bouillabaisse, and with the skin on (to prevent sticking) it is even grill-friendly.

        <p> The Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus), also known as the seawolf, Atlantic catfish, ocean catfish, devil fish, wolf eel (the common name for its Pacific relative), or sea cat, is a marine fish, the largest of the wolffish family Anarhichadidae. The numbers of the Atlantic wolffish are rapidly being depleted apparently due to overfishing and bycatch, and is currently a Species of Concern according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service.[1] Although it looks fearsome, the Atlantic wolffish is only a threat to humans when defending itself out of the water.[citation needed] Apart from their unique appearance wolffish are distinguished by the natural antifreeze they produce to keep their blood moving fluidly in their very cold habitat, involvement by both the male and female in brood bearing, and the large size of their eggs. They are also an important factor in controlling green crab and sea urchin populations, which can become overly disruptive to habitats if left unchecked. Wolffish population success is also an important indicator of the health of other bottom-dweller populations, such as cod.[2]
 </p>
        <p> In spite of its large size, the Atlantic wolffish has retained the bodily form and general external characteristics of small blennies (Blennioidei). The largest specimen recorded measured 150 cm (almost 5 ft) long and weighed almost 18 kg (40 lbs)[3] Its body is long, subcylindrical in front, compressed in the caudal portion, smooth and slippery, the rudimentary scales being embedded and almost hidden in the skin. Atlantic wolffish vary in color, usually seen as purplish-brown, a dull olive green, or blueish gray.[4] An even dorsal fin extends the whole length of the back, and a similar fin from the vent to the caudal fin, as in blennies. The pectorals are large and rounded and the pelvic fins are entirely absent. Its obtuse, eel-like body type makes the fish swim slowly, undulating from side to side, like an eel.[5]
