    <h3><a href="farmraisedturbot.html">Farmraised turbot</a></h3>
        <p>   Farm-raised turbot are generally smaller (1 to 4 pounds) and milder in flavor than wild turbot, which can reach 30 pounds but average 10 pounds. Several lesser-quality species of flatfish are sometimes passed off as European turbot, including  Greenland turbot and some West Coast flounders. Inferior in flavor and with softer flesh, these flatfish canâ€™t compare to the real turbot.
