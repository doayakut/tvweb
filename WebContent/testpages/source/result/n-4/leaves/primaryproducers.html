    <h3><a href="primaryproducers.html">Primary producers</a></h3>
        <p>   Primary producers are the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Global supplies are limited, which accounts for the high price this fish commands. Farmed production in France, Spain and Chile is supplementing wild harvests.  Farm-raised turbot are generally smaller (1 to 4 pounds) and milder in flavor than wild turbot, which can reach 30 pounds but average 10 pounds </p>
