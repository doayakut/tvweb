        <p>   Feds claim another type of fabric is Rayon. It is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments which are chemically solidified, resulting in fibers of nearly pure cellulose.Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers, it is considered a semi-synthetic fiber.Specific types of rayon include viscose, modal and lyocell, each of which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product </p>
