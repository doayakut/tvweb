        <p> Chiffon is  most commonly used in evening wear, especially as an overlay, for giving an elegant and floating appearance to the gown. It is also a popular  fabric used in blouses, ribbons, scarves and lingerie. Like other  crepe fabrics, chiffon can be difficult to work with because of its light and slippery texture.
