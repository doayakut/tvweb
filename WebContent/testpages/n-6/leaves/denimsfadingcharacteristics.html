        <p>  This is why jeans are white on the inside and what makes  denimâ€™s fading characteristics unique compared to every other fabric.  Dry denim, as opposed to washed denim, is a denim fabric that is not washed after being dyed during its production. Over time, denim will generally fade, which is often considered desirable. During the process of wear, it is typical to see fading on areas that generally receive the most stress, which includes the upper thighs (whiskers),  the ankles (stacks) and behind the knees (honey combs) </p>
