    <h3><a href="0.html">Dogfish
</a></h3>
        <p> This bone-free shark possesses many of the attributes U.S. consumers are looking for. Promoters hope to find greater acceptance for the  <a href="leaves/dogfish.html">dogfish</a> by marketing it under a Food-and-Drug-Administration-approved alternative name: “Cape shark.” Domestically, the species is found along the Pacific Coast from the Gulf of Alaska to Point Conception, California. On the Atlantic Coast, it roams between Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, and Cape Cod.  <a href="leaves/capeshark.html">Cape shark</a> is targeted by longliners and landed as a bycatch of gillnetters. Market size is about 3 feet, with an average weight of 7 to 10 pounds. Like all sharks,  <a href="leaves/dogfishareelasmobranchs.html">dogfish are elasmobranchs,</a> which means they have cartilage instead of bone for a skeleton. Sharks also lack a traditional urinary tract, so they concentrate urea, a waste product, in their blood and excrete it through their skin. As soon as it’s caught, dogfish must be gutted, bled and chilled. Otherwise, the urea remains in the flesh, and an ammonia smell develops within 24 hours.

        <p>  <a href="leaves/spinydogfishmeat.html">Spiny dogfish meat</a> has a sweet, mild flavor and a higher oil content than mako or other sharks. It has a flaky yet firm texture. The raw meat is white. The outer flesh can have a reddish color. If not cut away, the reddish portion turns brown when cooked. The rest of the meat cooks up white. The oil content helps keep the flesh moist. Dogfish meat should have a faintly sweet smell; although a slight metallic odor is acceptable, an ammonia taint is not. Creative cooking suggestions and preparations will increase customers’ willingness to try this versatile species. You can  <a href="leaves/deepfrydogfishas.html">deep fry dogfish, as</a> the British do for fish and chips, but don’t stop there. Use cubed meat for kebabs or in stir fries. Dogfish smokes nicely because of its oily flesh. The fins can be used in shark-fin soup, and the firm meat makes an ideal chowder ingredient.

        <p> The S. canicula are small, shallow-water sharks with a slender shaped body with a blunt head. The two dorsal fins are located towards the tail end of the body. The texture of their skin is rough, similar to the coarseness of sandpaper.[4] The nostrils are located on the underside of the snout and are connected to the mouth by a curved groove. The underside is a lighter greyish-white colour and the upper side is greyish-brown with darker spots. Dorsal colour is sandy and tightly tan, with numerous small spots and dark brown or nearly black in colour. The teeth of S. canicula in males are larger than in females. In male S. canicula from West African waters, their jaws are stronger, larger and more calcinated. The reasons for the changes in their mouth dimensions during maturation could explain their feeding habits and adaptations for reproductive behavior.[5]

        <p> Reproduction is oviparous. They deposit egg-cases that are protected by a horny capsule with long tendrils. The deposited egg-cases are mostly on macroalgae in shallow coastal waters. When the egg-cases are deposited farther from shore, they are placed on sessile erect invertebrates. These eggs usually measure 4 cm by 2 cm, without ever exceeding 6 cm.[6] These egg-cases can be found around the coasts of Europe. The embryos develop for 5–11 months, depending on the sea temperature and the young are born with a measurement of 9–10 cm. Spawning can take place almost all year round.[6] However, there are can be seasonal patterns in spawning activity as well. For example, S. canicula females that are located off the Mediterranean coast of France, lay their eggs from March to June and in December. In the waters surrounding Great Britain, egg laying occurs in spring with a gap between August and October.
