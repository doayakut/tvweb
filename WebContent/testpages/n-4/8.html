The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Fish List recognizes  <a href="leaves/fivegenusgroups.html">five genus groups</a>. The anchovy best known in culinary circles is Engraulis encrasicolus, the European or “true” anchovy, found in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and warmer waters of the East Atlantic. Its North American counterpart, E. mordax, aka northern or California anchovy, ranges off the West Coast from Mexico to British Columbia. Silvery fish with blue-green backs, anchovies are tiny; maximum length is 8 inches. They favor warmer waters around the globe, swimming in huge schools that feed on algae and zooplankton. They are caught by deepwater trawlers, and the majority of the catch is canned, salted, turned into paste or distilled to make the Southeast Asian fish sauces like the Vietnamese nuoc mam.  <a href="leaves/anchoviesareoftenconfusedwithsardines.html">Anchovies are often confused with sardines,</a> which in America are actually small herring.

        <p> A traditional method of processing and preserving anchovies is to gut and salt them in brine, allow them to mature, and then pack them in oil or salt. This results in a characteristic strong flavor and the flesh turns deep grey. Pickled in vinegar, as with Spanish boquerones, anchovies are milder and the flesh retains a white color. In Roman times, anchovies were the base for the fermented fish sauce garum. Garum had a sufficiently long shelf life for long-distance commerce, and was produced in industrial quantities. Anchovies were also eaten raw as an aphrodisiac.[27] Today they are used in small quantities to flavor many dishes. Because of the strong flavor, they are also an ingredient in several sauces and condiments, including Worcestershire sauce, Caesar salad dressing, remoulade, Gentleman’s Relish, many fish sauces, and in some versions of Café de Paris butter. For domestic use, anchovy fillets are packed in oil or salt in small tins or jars, sometimes rolled around capers. Anchovy paste is also available. Fishermen also use anchovies as bait for larger fish, such as tuna and sea bass.
 </p>
        <p> The strong taste people associate with anchovies is due to the curing process. Fresh anchovies, known in Italy as alici, have a much milder flavor.[28] In Sweden and Finland, the name anchovies is related strongly to a traditional seasoning, hence the product “anchovies” is normally made of sprats[29] and also herring can be sold as “anchovy-spiced”. Fish from the Engraulidae family is instead known as “sardell” in Sweden and “sardelli” in Finland, leading to confusion when translating recipes.
 </p>
        <p> Anchovies are found in scattered areas throughout the world’s oceans, but are concentrated in temperate waters, and are rare or absent in very cold or very warm seas. They are generally very accepting of a wide range of temperatures and salinity.
