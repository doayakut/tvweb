        <p> You’d be hard pressed to find a group of fish with more harvest methods, real names and aliases than the Sebastes genus. The 70 or so fish in this family range from the Bering Sea to Baja California. Many take their common names and nicknames from  <a href="leaves/theirskincolor.html">their skin color</a>. And the deeper they live (to 300 fathoms), the brighter their coloration.  <a href="leaves/otherrockfishnames.html">Other rockfish names</a> reflect physical characteristics: quillback, pygmy, shortbelly, longspine, yellow-eye. The  <a href="leaves/mostimportantcommercialspecies.html">most important commercial species</a> are the Pacific ocean perch and the widow, canary, chilipepper, yelloweye, vermillion and thornyhead rockfish. The fish can range in size from 1 to 40 pounds, but 2 to 5 pounds is most common. Rockfish are caught by trolling, trawling, longlining, jigging, trapping and gillnetting — either targeted or as bycatch. Rockfish are extremely slow growing, making them susceptible to overfishing.
 </p>
        <p>  <a href="leaves/rockfishhasadelicatenuttysweetflavor.html">Rockfish has a delicate, nutty, sweet flavor</a>. The meat is lean and medium-firm in texture, with a fine flake. Deep-skinned rockfish with the fat line removed have the most delicate flavor. The skin should be shiny and bright. If it is a yellow-orange color or is wrinkled and looks too large for the fish, the fish is stale.  <a href="leaves/fillets.html">Fillets</a> shouldn’t have signs of browning, graying or yellowing. Rockfish generally fall into two categories: red-fleshed and brown-fleshed. Red-fleshed fillets are generally considered more desirable, because they are less oily and have a longer shelf life. Rockfish holds up well to baking and remains moist when cooked. The firm texture also makes rockfish suitable for soups, chowders and stews.

        <p> You’d be hard pressed to find a group of fish with more harvest methods, real names and aliases than the Sebastes genus. The 70 or so fish in this family range from the Bering Sea to Baja California. Many take their common names and nicknames from their skin color: green, brown, dusky, blue, black, copper, olive, red and so on. And the deeper they live (to 300 fathoms), the brighter their coloration. Other rockfish names reflect physical characteristics: quillback, pygmy, shortbelly, longspine, yellow-eye. The most important commercial species are the Pacific ocean perch and the widow, canary, chilipepper, yelloweye, vermillion and thornyhead rockfish.

        <p> Sebastes is a genus of fish in the family Sebastidae (though some include this in Scorpaenidae), most of which have the common name of rockfish. A few are called ocean perch, sea perch or redfish instead. Most of the Sebastes species live in the north Pacific, although two (S. capensis and S. oculatus) live in the south Pacific/Atlantic and four (S. fasciatus, S. mentella, S. norvegicus and S. viviparus) live in the north Atlantic. The coast off South California is the area of highest rockfish diversity, with 56 species living in the Southern California Bight. The fossil record of rockfish goes back to the Miocene, from California and Japan (although fossil otoliths from Belgium, “Sebastes” weileri, may push the record back as far as the Oligocene).
 </p>
        <p> Rockfish are an important sport and commercial fish, and many species have been overfished. As a result seasons are tightly controlled in many areas. Sebastes are sometimes fraudulently substituted for the more expensive red snapper (L. campechanus).[3]  Rockfish range from the intertidal zone to almost 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) deep, usually living benthically on various substrates, often (as the name suggests) around rock outcrops. Some rockfish species are very long-lived, amongst the longest-living fish on earth, with several species known to surpass 100 years of age, and a maximum reported age of 205 years for S. aleutianus.[4]

        <p> Like all carnivores, these fish can bioaccumulate some pollutants or radionuclides as cesium. Highly radioactive rockfish have been caught in a port near Fukushima city, Japan, not far from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, nearly two years after the nuclear disaster (ex: 107000 Bq/kg[5] (2013-02-12) ; 116000 Bq/kg[5] (2013-02-13) and 132000Bq/kg[5] (2013-02-13), respectively 1070, 1160 and 1320 more than Japanese standard time (as updated on April 1, 2012[5]).
