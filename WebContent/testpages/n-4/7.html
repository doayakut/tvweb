        <p>  <a href="leaves/bluefisharevoraciousfeeders.html">Bluefish are voracious feeders</a> and fierce fighters, earning them the name “chopper” among fishermen. Blues can weigh up to 30 pounds; fish bigger than 10 pounds are called “horses,” while youngsters of 1 to 2 pounds are known as “snappers.” Average market size is 3 to 5 pounds. Bluefish travel up and down the eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida, following schools of small, oil-rich menhaden, a favored food. This diet of pogies gives older blues their pronounced flavor.  <a href="leaves/youngerbluefish.html">Younger bluefish</a> eat crustaceans, resulting in a sweeter and milder flesh. Main bluefish producers are the Chesapeake Bay area, New Jersey and Long Island, and North Carolina has a significant winter fishery.  <a href="leaves/bluefishdeterioratesrapidly.html">Bluefish deteriorates rapidly</a> if not immediately iced, and it doesn’t freeze well. That’s why the fish is seldom seen far from where it’s landed unless flown in by a restaurant as a special. So buy in season and handle with care.
 </p>
        <p> The meat of  <a href="leaves/uncookedbluefish.html">uncooked bluefish</a> ranges from a light putty color to blue-gray with a brownish tinge. It becomes lighter when cooked. A strong-flavored, dark strip of meat on the fillet may be removed before cooking. Bluefish has a rich, full flavor and coarse, moist meat with edible skin. The larger the fish, the more pronounced the taste. Plan to cook bluefish within a day of purchase. True fish lovers appreciate the rich, strong flavor of blues, which can be nicely complemented by acidic ingredients like lime and lemon juice or tomato. For  <a href="leaves/aneasyentre.html">an easy entrée,</a> simply brush a fillet with mustard or mayonnaise and broil it. Bluefish also can be grilled, roasted or baked. Only small bluefish can be fried, since larger fish are too oily. Large fish can be baked whole.

        <p> The bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) is the only extant species of the family Pomatomidae. It is a marine pelagic fish found around the world in temperate and subtropical waters, except for the northern Pacific Ocean. Bluefish are known as tailor in Australia,[1] shad on the east coast of South Africa, elf on the west coast, γοφάρι (gofari) or λουφάρι (loufari) in modern Greek, and similarly, lüfer[2] in Turkish and луфарь/lufar in Russian. Other common names are blue, chopper, and anchoa.[3] It is good eating and a popular gamefish. The bluefish is a moderately proportioned fish, with a broad, forked tail. The spiny first dorsal fin is normally folded back in a groove, as are its pectoral fins. Coloration is a grayish blue-green dorsally, fading to white on the lower sides and belly. Its single row of teeth in each jaw are uniform in size, knife-edged, and sharp. Bluefish commonly range in size from seven-inch (18-cm) “snappers” to much larger, sometimes weighing as much as 40 pounds (18 kg), though fish heavier than 20 pounds (9 kg) are exceptional.

        <p> Bluefish are widely distributed around the world in tropical and subtropical waters. They are found in pelagic waters on much of the continental shelves along eastern America (though not between south Florida and northern South America), Africa, the Mediterranean and Black Seas (and during migration in between), Southeast Asia, and Australia. They are found in a variety of coastal habitats: above the continental shelf, in energetic waters near surf beaches, or by rock headlands.[4] They also enter estuaries and inhabit brackish waters.[5][6][7] Periodically, they leave the coasts and migrate in schools through open waters.[8][9]
