        <p>  The  lean, pearly white flesh of the wolffish has a firm texture and a mild, sweet flavor, sometimes likened to lobster. The meat has a flake similar to codâ€™s but not as large.  Wolffish skin is edible, but since there are no scales, this species cannot be kosher. Not as firm as monkfish nor as delicate as sole, the versatile wolffish holds together well and can be cooked successfully by many methods </p>
