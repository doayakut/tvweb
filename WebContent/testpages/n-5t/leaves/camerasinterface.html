        <p> Overall, I really like the  camera's interface, which should be familiar to any recent Pentax shooter; though the buttons have moved around from where you might be used to encountering them. I also find the company's interactive control panel a little counterintuitive after being away from it for a while. On other cameras, on the brief info screen you hit a button and then navigate around the screen, changing settings. On a Pentax, you see all the important settings on the control screen, but have to hit different buttons to change each setting </p>
