        <p>  The Canon EOS 70D's  new sensor delivers excellent autofocus performance and the camera itself is quite fast. Its design is reasonably streamlined and the feature set appropriately tailored to the target market as well. I'm beginning to think Canon really pushes the contrast on its default Picture Style to increase perceived sharpness of the photos, because when you look at details closely they seem awfully soft. You lose a lot of  shadow and highlight detail if you leave the Picture Style on Auto, though </p>
