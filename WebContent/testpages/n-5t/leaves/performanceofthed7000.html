    <h3><a href="performanceofthed7000.html">performance of the D7000</a></h3>
        <p>  The D7100 maintains the excellent  performance of the D7000, and it's about what you'd expect for a $1,200 camera. (Note that though I've included the D7000 results in the chart for reference, they're not directly comparable since our testing methodology has changed since we tested the D7000.) The sensor has improved readout speed over the D7000's, which Nikon attributes to a more efficient design rather than more output channels, and improved noise reduction in part because of an upgrade to the current Expeed 3 image-processing engine.
