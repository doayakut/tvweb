        <p>  And yes, it's not painfully slow to use, like cameras in this class used to be ( its predecessor, the L810 is downright sluggish by comparison). But it's not great in low light and indoors without a flash, it can be slow to focus with the lens extended, and shooting performance in general is best suited for slow-moving or stationary subjects.  AA-battery-powered cameras tend to be slower performers than cameras that use rechargeable lithium ion battery packs. The L820, however, is reasonably fast </p>
