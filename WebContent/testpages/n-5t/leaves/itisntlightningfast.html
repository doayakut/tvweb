        <p> If you're feeling like you're not getting the shots you want from your smartphone because it's just not fast enough, you won't fare much better with the WB800F (or most other point-and-shoots in its class); it's not slow, but  it isn't lightning-fast, either. From off to first shot takes 3.7 seconds, which is longer than competing cameras take, and the lag from shot to shot averaged 1.9 seconds </p>
