        <p>  The Fujiflim FinePix F900EXR  falls into "enthusiast" group, but it's a very capable "family camera," with solid results if you just leave it in auto. Though its photo quality and performance still isn't that of larger-sensor cameras like dSLRs and mirrorless compacts, you're not going to get one of those with a 25-500mm zoom lens.
