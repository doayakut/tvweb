    <h3><a href="nobluetoothgpsornfc.html">no Bluetooth GPS or NFC</a></h3>
        <p> The WB800F doesn't have a SIM card slot for mobile broadband and there's  no Bluetooth, GPS, or NFC; it's not running on Android; and its 3-inch touch screen is dwarfed by the 4.8-inch one on the Galaxy. It is, however, considerably less expensive because of all this and the photo quality and performance are for the most part the same (actually the WB800F performs a bit better in some respects). The Samsung WB800F's picture quality is very good for its class </p>
