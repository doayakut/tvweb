    <h3><a href="liveviewvideooptimizedautofocus.html">Live Viewvideooptimized autofocus</a></h3>
        <p>  It comes with a completely overhauled,  Live View/video-optimized autofocus system that doesn't require special lenses; a more streamlined body design with an articulated touch screen; and Wi-Fi support. And with only a couple of exceptions, I like the 70D and enjoy shooting with it; it's fast and fluid. However, pixel peepers will likely be disappointed with the still photo quality, which really should be better for the money.
