    <h3><a href="wificonnectivity.html">WiFi connectivity</a></h3>
        <p>  The X-M1's  Wi-Fi connectivity is also a nice option, but the current (albeit fixable) implementation leaves quite a bit to be desired. For what it's worth, the X-M1 displays the best photo quality I've seen thus far in a sub-$1,000 camera kit. Thanks to Fujifilm's X-Trans sensor and excellent image processing, even the JPEG photos are not just usable, but really good up through ISO 1600. Shots  as high as ISO 6400 remain pretty usable at full size as well, depending upon image content </p>
