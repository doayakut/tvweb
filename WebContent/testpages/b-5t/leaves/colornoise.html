    <h3><a href="colornoise.html">color noise</a></h3>
        <p>  Details start to soften at ISO 200 and at ISO 400,  color noise becomes more noticeable, too. At ISO 800, you'll start to see faint  yellow blotching, which becomes more pronounced at ISO sensitivities above that. Aside from the blotching and increased softness, though, color and detail are good and, for the most part, these things aren't visible at smaller sizes. Basically, if you're looking for digital SLR quality, you're not going to find it </p>
