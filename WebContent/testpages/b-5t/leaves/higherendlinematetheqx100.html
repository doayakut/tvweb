        <p>  The Cyber-shot DSC-QX10 and its  higher-end linemate, the QX100, are essentially compact cameras redesigned for people who've forsaken standalone cameras for their smartphone's. The cameras wirelessly link to your smartphone (or tablet if you want) via a direct Wi-Fi connection and, with the help of Sony's PlayMemories Mobile app (for now, at least), let you use your device as a viewfinder and interface for the camera. Because of the way they look and physically attach to your smartphone, it would be easy to mistake them for some sort of  add-on lens that works with your smartphone's built-in camera, magically combining all the strengths of its shooter with the power of a zoom lens. There is no magic here, though, and perhaps that's what's most disappointing about the QX10 </p>
