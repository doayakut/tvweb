        <p>  The F900EXR is great as a  leave-it-in-auto compact camera. However, while it doesn't have the larger sensors or fast lenses of Fujifilm's X-series cameras, it does have some things that enthusiasts will appreciate, such as manual and semimanual shooting modes, raw capture, and quick access to important settings. It's a fast camera and takes excellent pictures, too, though to get the best results from it, you'll need to explore its various modes and settings. And yes, it has built-in Wi-Fi, so as long as you have a  mobile-broadband-connected iOS or Android smartphone or tablet, you'll be able to shoot and share your shots from anywhere </p>
