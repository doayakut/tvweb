    <h3><a href="0.html">Fujifilm FinePix F900EXR
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Fujifilm's FinePix point-and-shoots have taken a backseat to its enthusiast compact models like the X20. Still, there are a handful of its FinePix models that deserve attention -- by hobbyists or more-casual snapshooters -- such as the 42x zoom HS50EXR and its pocketable sibling, the 20x zoom F900EXR. The F900EXR is great as a  <a href="leaves/leaveitinautocompact.html">leave-it-in-auto compact</a> camera. However, while it doesn't have the larger sensors or fast lenses of Fujifilm's X-series cameras, it does have some things that enthusiasts will appreciate, such as manual and semimanual shooting modes, raw capture, and quick access to important settings. It's a fast camera and takes excellent pictures, too, though to get the best results from it, you'll need to explore its various modes and settings. And yes, it has built-in Wi-Fi, so as long as you have a  <a href="leaves/mobilebroadbandconnected.html">mobile-broadband-connected</a> iOS or Android smartphone or tablet, you'll be able to shoot and share your shots from anywhere.
 </p>
        <p> From a photo quality standpoint, the F900EXR can produce some of the best photos you'll get from a camera in this class. The overall quality --  <a href="leaves/especiallyathigherisos.html">especially at higher ISOs</a> -- doesn't compare with what you get from cameras with larger sensors like dSLRs, but for a small-sensor compact megazoom, it's quite good. When viewed at full size, its 16-megapixel pictures are on the soft side with visible artifacts right down to its lowest ISO setting -- not great for enlarging and heavily cropping. (That can be said for almost all cameras in this class, though.)

    <h3><a href="1.html">Canon EOS 70D
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> There's so much to like about the eagerly awaited replacement for the Canon EOS 60D, the 70D. It comes with a completely overhauled,  <a href="leaves/liveviewvideooptimizedautofocus.html">Live View/video-optimized autofocus</a> system that doesn't require special lenses; a more streamlined body design with an articulated touch screen; and Wi-Fi support. And with only a couple of exceptions, I like the 70D and enjoy shooting with it; it's fast and fluid. However, pixel peepers will likely be disappointed with the still photo quality, which really should be better for the money.
 </p>
        <p> The image quality didn't change noticeably between my preproduction tests and my final tests, but my opinion has. It's...fine. Not outstanding for the money, but not bad, either. However, it's simply not as good as the Nikon D7100. Yes, it's still an advance over  <a href="leaves/itspredecessor60d.html">its predecessor 60D,</a> but not enormously -- I don't think you even gain a full stop of usability, and any advantages seem to stem from the slight increase in resolution. It's a bit better than  <a href="leaves/therebelt5i.html">the Rebel T5i</a> across the entire sensitivity range, though you really have to scrutinize them. (The T5i looks better starting at ISO 1600, but that seems to be because the T5i meters a third of a stop brighter.)  <a href="leaves/greatdealoncanoneos70d.html">Great Deal on Canon EOS 70D</a>.

    <h3><a href="2.html">Canon PowerShot G16
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> As a news announcement, Canon's PowerShot G16 enthusiast compact was a bit of a yawner: basically, it gains Wi-Fi and 1080/60p video over its predecessor, the G15.  <a href="leaves/canonsawesomelypowerfulcompactcameras.html">Canon's awesomely powerful compact cameras</a>. As a camera, though, the G series is slowly improving. Given that it was once one of the cameras that defined the enthusiast category it's sad to see it slip compared with competitors. Like the G15, the G16 has excellent image quality at  <a href="leaves/lowisosensitivities.html">low ISO sensitivities,</a> but its performance is significantly improved -- still not the fastest option in its class, but no longer the slug it was. Its feature set continues to lag comparatively, but overall the camera remains a nice option for manual-control devotees who don't want to schlep around a dSLR and who still find compact interchangeable-lens cameras a bit too large.
 </p>
        <p> The  <a href="leaves/g16sphotoquality.html">G16's photo quality</a> is about the same as the G15's, though looking back at that review I think it might have gained an extra stop of usability through tweaks in the JPEG processing. While very good for a small-sensor camera, photo quality still doesn't quite match that of the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100. For JPEGs, images look good up through ISO 400, then  <a href="leaves/artifacts.html">artifacts</a> begin to become quite apparent. While there's no great dynamic range or unsuppressed noise in the raw files, with some adjustments you can produce shots as high as ISO 1600 by processing them to better handle the tradeoffs of noise and sharpness. That said, I couldn't get decent prints out of my ISO 1600 shots.

    <h3><a href="3.html">Nikon Coolpix L820
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Considering its street price of less than $200, the Nikon Coolpix L820 boasts an  <a href="leaves/attractivesetofspecs.html">attractive set of specs</a>. The star is obviously the 30x zoom lens, which starts at an ultrawide-angle 22.5mm and zooms out to 675mm. That covers a lot of ground and gives you great framing flexibility. Along with that you get a 16-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor (something typically found in higher-end point-and-shoots) and a high-resolution 3-inch LCD. And, it's powered by four AA-size batteries, which is becoming increasingly rare.
 </p>
        <p> It is, however, still an entry-level point-and-shoot and performs like one. Yes, you can get some pretty nice pictures and movies out of it. And yes, it's not painfully slow to use, like cameras in this class used to be ( <a href="leaves/itspredecessorthel810.html">its predecessor, the L810</a> is downright sluggish by comparison). But it's not great in low light and indoors without a flash, it can be slow to focus with the lens extended, and shooting performance in general is best suited for slow-moving or stationary subjects.  <a href="leaves/aabatterypoweredcameras.html">AA-battery-powered cameras</a> tend to be slower performers than cameras that use rechargeable lithium ion battery packs. The L820, however, is reasonably fast. From off to first shot is 1.5 seconds. The time from pressing the shutter release to capture without prefocusing is just over 0.1 second in bright lighting and 0.5 second in low lighting. Shot-to-shot times averaged 1.2 seconds. The time between shots when using the flash is nearly as good at 1.3 seconds, which is remarkably fast.

</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Despite some high-profile changes in the Nikon D7100, such as a new sensor, updated AF system, and better build quality, this long-overdue update to the Nikon D7000 doesn't stand out from the crowd as much as it should for the money. Where once the company had to worry only about Canon with respect to advanced amateur SLRs, Pentax and Sony now produce some killer cameras, sturdily built and capable of shooting great photos with great speed. Plus  <a href="leaves/nikonsownd5200.html">Nikon's own D5200,</a> while not as fast or as well-built, may be good enough for a lot of folks. Don't get me wrong -- the D7100 is an excellent camera. But with missing capabilities and excellent-but-not-class-leading image quality, it's not a no-brainer buy.
 </p>
        <p> Though it has the same sensor resolution as the D5200, the D7100 uses a new and different sensor that does away with the optical low-pass filter (OLPF),  <a href="leaves/akaantialiasingfilter.html">aka antialiasing filter,</a> much like the Pentax K-5 IIs. Dropping the filter is intended to increase the sharpness of the native images without introducing the types of artifacts you get when sharpening in post.

    <h3><a href="5.html">HP Photosmart R937
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Don't judge a book by its cover, and don't judge a camera by its appearance. HP's 8-megapixel Photosmart R937 might look strange, but its unique design makes it one of the more pleasant snapshot cameras to work with. The R937 looks downright cyclopean, with its lens sitting in the center of an otherwise smooth, matte-black shell. A huge touchscreen dominates the back of the device, making it look more like a  <a href="leaves/stylishviewmaster.html">stylish View-Master</a> than a camera. Though these design elements might be aesthetically questionable, together they form a simple, intuitive camera that's easy to pick up and use.
 </p>
        <p> Like most touchscreen-based cameras, the  <a href="leaves/r937eschewsall.html">R937 eschews all</a> but the most basic buttons in favor of an interface almost entirely controlled by its 3.6-inch screen. The large display and colorful, simply designed menu system makes changing most settings a breeze. When you begin shooting, only shooting mode, resolution, and flash options appear on the screen, giving you an otherwise unobstructed view of your subject. As you change more settings, such as white balance or sensitivity (aka ISO), those settings appear as their own buttons on the screen. This simple design element works very well to keep the interface clean, while leaving often-modified options readily available. While the touchscreen menu lets you change nearly every setting on the camera, it does not control the 39mm-to-118mm equivalent, f/3.5-to-f/4.2,  <a href="leaves/3xopticalzoomlens.html">3X optical zoom lens</a>. If you want to zoom in or out, you must deal with a tiny zoom rocker that's barely larger than a grain of rice and is crammed on the right edge of the screen.

If you want to zoom in or out, you must deal with a tiny zoom rocker that's barely larger than a grain of rice and is crammed on the right edge of the screen.

    <h3><a href="6.html">Olympus PEN E-P5
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Normally a two-year product cycle isn't that much for a camera targeted at advanced photographers. But in a field where technology mutates as quickly as it does for advanced interchangeable-lens cameras, that's a long time. So at two years since the Olympus PEN E-P3, it feels like it's taken just a little too long for the PEN E-P5's debut. But in addition to incorporating the sensor, autofocus, and  <a href="leaves/imagestabilizationsystems.html">image stabilization systems</a> from the E-M5, the E-P5 gains a tiltable touch screen; broader scene analysis in auto mode; 1080/30p video; and other features. All the changes add up to what feels like a completely different camera, with better photo quality, a more streamlined design, faster performance, and a broader feature set.
 </p>
        <p> You can buy the camera either as body-only or as a kit that includes the 17mm f1.8 lens plus add-on electronic viewfinder. The latter configuration is expensive, but I'm quite partial to the  <a href="leaves/evf.html">EVF</a>. It's humongous, but it's a lot more stable to shoot that way. If you do opt for the body only, resist the impulse to pair it with the cheap 14-42mm lens; a camera like this really cries out for a sharp, high-quality lens. The E-P5 delivers the best image quality I've seen from a Micro Four Thirds camera, finally ratcheting up my image quality rating, but it's still not quite as good as APS-C competitors.  <a href="leaves/olympuspenep5releasedate.html">Olympus PEN E-P5 release date</a>. The camera's JPEGs look good up through ISO 400, and OK through ISO 800; by ISO 1600 the noise suppression gets aggressive. I really wouldn't shoot at ISO 3200 or higher with the E-P5. As it is, at ISO 1600, only the precisely sharp areas look good viewed at 100 percent, though 13x19 prints look OK. You can gain a little latitude by shooting raw, though you're generally exchanging mushiness for graininess. Olympus' image processing has gotten better since the O-MD E-M5, with less sharpening and less of the crunchy look.

    <h3><a href="7.html">Panasonic Lumix DMC
</a></h3>
        <p> For the Lumix DMC, Panasonic took what was already an excellent camera, the  <a href="leaves/zs20.html">ZS20,</a> tweaked it a bit and added Wi-Fi. The result is another excellent compact megazoom that gives you a bit more for your money. With so many good options in this category, perhaps what's nicest about the ZS30 is that it's fun to use. Even though it offers things like semimanual and manual shooting modes and a fair amount of control over results, casual snapshooters should have an easy time getting good shots out of it with little effort. Basically, it's just what the ZS20 was -- a well-rounded travel zoom -- that now has Wi-Fi so you can shoot and share on the go.
 </p>
        <p> Despite a resolution bump from 14 to 18 megapixels, the ZS30's photo quality isn't appreciably better than the ZS20's. Viewed at full size on screen, there is visible noise/artifacts even at its lowest ISO setting. Details start to soften at ISO 200 and at ISO 400,  <a href="leaves/colornoise.html">color noise</a> becomes more noticeable, too. At ISO 800, you'll start to see faint  <a href="leaves/yellowblotching.html">yellow blotching,</a> which becomes more pronounced at ISO sensitivities above that. Aside from the blotching and increased softness, though, color and detail are good and, for the most part, these things aren't visible at smaller sizes. Basically, if you're looking for digital SLR quality, you're not going to find it. If you're looking for good photos for prints up to 8x10 inches and Web use, and don't typically do a lot of enlarging or heavy cropping, you should be pretty pleased with the results.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> About six-and-a-half years ago, Olympus announced the E-Volt E-410, which at that point became the smallest dSLR ever. In the years since, I don't remember anybody attempting to match it for size. But given that it used a Four Thirds-size sensor -- smaller than the traditional APS-C size sensor that's used by consumer dSLRs -- that was pretty unsurprising. Now Canon's EOS Rebel SL1 manages to  <a href="leaves/outdothee410.html">outdo the E-410</a> for lightness and compactness, at least in two dimensions (the E-410 was thinner), becoming the smallest dSLR available.
 </p>
        <p> The result is a nice, fast, though somewhat feature-light, dSLR that I find very  <a href="leaves/comfortabletogriponehanded.html">comfortable to grip one-handed</a>. Then again, I have relatively diminutive hands compared with the more masculinely proportioned Josh Goldman (CNET's other digital imaging editor), who finds the grip exceptionally cramped. However, it's still significantly bigger than competing interchangeable-lens compacts like the Sony Alpha NEX-6, which makes the more compact design dubiously advantageous. Essentially a shrunken version of the T5i that's targeted at folks with smaller hands -- the SL stands for "super lightweight," though Canon might as well as have gone with WF for "womenfolk" -- there are a few notable differences between the SL1 and its big brother.  <a href="leaves/physicalweightanddimensionsofthecanonrebelsl1.html">Physical weight and dimensions of the Canon Rebel SL1</a>. For one, it incorporates an updated version of the company's hybrid CMOS, which Canon claims offers a larger area dedicated to the contrast AF system for better autofocus outside the center area during Live View shooting and movie capture. (And it makes me wonder why they didn't use this sensor in the T5i.) Other differences include a fixed, rather than articulated, version of the touch-screen LCD, a slightly slower continuous-shooting capability, and mono audio. The battery life is also weaker, as it uses the same battery pack as the EOS M. For the most part, the photo and video look about the same as those from the T5i. Still-photo colors aren't bad with the default Picture Style settings, though there are some hue shifts. JPEGs look clean up through ISO 800, which is typical for this class, and usable at full scale to about  <a href="leaves/iso1600.html">ISO 1600</a> and ISO 6400 at smaller magnifications. While a 13x19 print of an ISO 1600 photo wasn't quite as clean or sharp as I would have liked, it doesn't look that bad, but that's still not as good as the T5i.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> For its latest top-of-the-line dSLR, the K-3, Pentax overhauls the K-5 II/IIs inside and out: it's got a new sensor, new body design,  <a href="leaves/newafsystem.html">new AF system,</a> new metering system, and improved performance. I had a chance to spend some time with an early model that displayed some not-unexpected firmware wonkiness that prevent my reporting on image quality or performance, but it looks like a promising start with some interesting twists. As for Pentaxians who don't need the latest and greatest, the K-5 II and IIs will remain in the line at lower prices, although Pentax hasn't announced what those will be yet.
 </p>
        <p> Like the IIs (and the Nikon D7100), the K-3's new 24MP drops  <a href="leaves/theopticallowpassfilter.html">the optical low-pass filter</a> (OLPF) entirely. But sometimes you want the slight blurring effect of the OLPF, especially if you know moire will be a problem -- and Pentax takes a novel approach to addressing that concern. The K-3 can use its sensor-shift shake reduction mechanism to slightly offset the pixels with circular, horizontal, or vertical movements. It doesn't seem to be available in movie mode, however. To compensate for the increased vulnerability of the sensor, there's now a vibrating piece of coated glass over it for dust protection and removal. The new autofocus system unfortunately doesn't have any  <a href="leaves/liveviewoptimizations.html">Live View optimizations,</a> though Pentax says that five of the AF sensors are specifically for low light, and even the preproduction model was able to lock focus in some pretty dim conditions. Pentax also takes a leaf out of Nikon's and Canon's book, implementing a more granular, RGB metering system and using the data from the light meter to supplement the autofocus. Like the Canon EOS 70D, it now implements Zone Focus, though it doesn't display the zone -- just the selected focus point -- on prefocus. It does seem to select the center of the zone more often then not (which is good). The camera retains the expanded area AF as well.

On the outside, you'll find an  <a href="leaves/lcdonback.html">LCD on back</a> for framing and viewing your shots as well as a smaller LCD on front for self-portraits. This second screen can also be used to display a short animation to get the attention of a small child or possibly a pet as well as a countdown when using the self-timer. Inside, there's a Wi-Fi radio for sending those self-portraits straight to a smartphone or tablet for instant uploading and sharing, or backing up on a computer or in cloud storage, or directly sending by e-mail or uploading to Facebook, among several other options.
 </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, Samsung also put inside an inferior sensor to the  <a href="leaves/backsideilluminatedbsi.html">backside-illuminated (BSI)</a> CMOS ones found in its slightly higher-end models, like the WB250F Smart Camera. The choice no doubt helped keep the price low, less than $150 in this case, but it also makes the DV150F less capable in low light without a flash. But, if you do most of your shooting outdoors in good light, the DV150F's two fun features make this reasonably priced problem-solving camera worth considering.

        <p> The Kodak EasyShare Z5010 is a good example of what Kodak did best with its digital cameras. Instead of going after the entire market, Kodak concentrated on making cameras that were easy to use and a good value, and that's the Z5010 all over.  <a href="leaves/kodakeasysharez5010bestfeatures.html">Kodak EasyShare Z5010 best features</a>. It's a basic point-and-shoot, but still has a manual mode for shutter speed and aperture control, with a 21x zoom lens, a 3-inch LCD, and AA batteries for power. It also has Kodak's Share button, which lets you easily tag photos and video clips for quick uploading to sharing sites, e-mailing, or sending to Kodak's Pulse picture frames when the camera's connected to a computer.
 </p>
        <p> However, the Z5010's photos are just a step above what you'd get from a good smartphone and its shooting performance is fairly slow -- both typical for this class of camera. And the Z5010 feels like  <a href="leaves/anentrylevelcamera.html">an entry-level camera,</a> too. Then again, you do get a nice wide and long lens and it's priced to move; you can find it for about $100 less than its original $199.95 price.

Basically, if you view its  <a href="leaves/14megapixelpictures.html">14-megapixel pictures</a> at larger sizes, 80 to 100 percent, you'll see a good deal of noise and artifacts, and subjects look soft and lack fine detail. That's even at its lowest sensitivity of ISO 64. This is only really a problem if you frequently enlarge and heavily crop your photos or are making prints larger than 8x10. At smaller screen and print sizes, photos taken with plenty of light look good.

Instead of going after the entire market, Kodak concentrated on making cameras that were easy to use and a good value, and that's the Z5010 all over. Kodak EasyShare Z5010 best features. It's a basic point-and-shoot, but still has a manual mode for shutter speed and aperture control, with a 21x zoom lens, a 3-inch LCD, and AA batteries for power. It also has Kodak's Share button, which lets you easily tag photos and video clips for quick uploading to sharing sites, e-mailing, or sending to Kodak's Pulse picture frames when the camera's connected to a computer.
 </p>
        <p> However, the Z5010's photos are just a step above what you'd get from a good smartphone and its shooting performance is fairly slow -- both typical for this class of camera. And the Z5010 feels like an entry-level camera, too. Then again, you do get a nice wide and long lens and it's priced to move; you can find it for about $100 less than its original $199.95 price. The Kodak EasyShare Z5010 is capable of taking some very good photos, but it is not without limitations. Basically, if you view its 14-megapixel pictures at larger sizes, 80 to 100 percent, you'll see a good deal of noise and artifacts, and subjects look soft and lack fine detail. That's even at its lowest sensitivity of ISO 64. This is only really a problem if you frequently enlarge and heavily crop your photos or are making prints larger than 8x10. At smaller screen and print sizes, photos taken with plenty of light look good.

        <p> Fujifilm brings its interchangeable-lens camera line down another price notch with the addition of the X-M1. It's essentially a cheaper version of the X-E1, which swaps the viewfinder for a host of other features. The  <a href="leaves/fujifilmxm1wasrecentlyusedtoshootamovie.html">Fujifilm X-M1 was recently used to shoot a movie</a>. The X-M1 is based around the same sensor as the X-E1, probably the new model's most notable feature compared with competitors. While the X-E1 has an electronic viewfinder and mic input, plus sports a far more  <a href="leaves/retrodesign.html">retro design,</a> in trade-off the much cheaper X-M1 has a larger, higher-resolution LCD, built-in Wi-Fi for image transfer, and an updated EXR Processor II from the X100S.
 </p>
        <p> I tested both the X-M1 and X-E1 more or less simultaneously, which turned out to be a mixed blessing. While I have no qualms about the photo quality, which is excellent and seems like a steal in the cheaper X-M1, I kept wishing for a camera that combined the best of both models: the body and kit lens of the X-E1 with the better, tilting LCD of the X-M1. The X-M1's  <a href="leaves/wificonnectivity.html">Wi-Fi connectivity</a> is also a nice option, but the current (albeit fixable) implementation leaves quite a bit to be desired. For what it's worth, the X-M1 displays the best photo quality I've seen thus far in a sub-$1,000 camera kit. Thanks to Fujifilm's X-Trans sensor and excellent image processing, even the JPEG photos are not just usable, but really good up through ISO 1600. Shots  <a href="leaves/ashighasiso6400.html">as high as ISO 6400</a> remain pretty usable at full size as well, depending upon image content. But I really wish the company hadn't felt compelled to invoke expanded ISO sensitivity range marketing voodoo on the high end (I have no problem with it for ISO 100). Before I realized that the expanded range option simply wasn't appearing because I shoot raw+JPEG -- it's not available with raw -- I thought "Wow. A camera that actually produces usable shots across it's entire ISO sensitivity range." Then I realized my error and found the useless upper ranges.

    <h3><a href="14.html">Sony Alpha ILCE-3000
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Despite being one of the few growing segments of the digital camera market, mirrorless versions of interchangeable-lens cameras still don't get no respect. For one, there's a perception in some quarters that they don't produce the same image quality as dSLRs, even though they're nearly identical in all the ways that affect image quality. I also think there's a grip issue; for the most part, ILCs tend to sacrifice a decent grip for compactness and sleek design. Only the Sony NEX models offer  <a href="leaves/asubstantialgrip.html">a substantial grip,</a> and I think that's a large factor in their popularity. Finally, because they're smaller and tend to be targeted at folks stepping up from point-and-shoots, we all expect at least the entry-level models to be cheaper than they are -- not the typical $500-plus at launch. Sony's Alpha ILCE-3000 (aka the Sony A3000) attempts to jump all these hurdles at once by stuffing one of  <a href="leaves/itsnexcameras.html">its NEX cameras</a> into a dSLR body and pricing it aggressively at $400 for the kit.
 </p>
        <p> Rather than shrinking one of its  <a href="leaves/singlelenstranslucentslt.html">single-lens translucent (SLT)</a> models the way Canon compressed a dSLR for the SL1 -- which likely would have resulted in a more expensive model -- Sony based a mirrorless dSLR-style body around its E-Mount lenses and NEX menu and control system. Overall, the idea makes a lot of sense. Once you drop the mirror, the biggest constraint to shrinkage becomes the lens mount. And on the surface (though not necessarily in practice), the NEX menu system looks a lot friendlier for the presumably novice buyer of this camera. It's telling that the closest price competitors for the A3000, like the Canon T3, are generally about two years old.

    <h3><a href="15.html">Sony Cyber-shot QX10
</a></h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> You have to give Sony credit for trying something new to stem declining point-and-shoot sales. The Cyber-shot DSC-QX10 and its  <a href="leaves/higherendlinematetheqx100.html">higher-end linemate, the QX100,</a> are essentially compact cameras redesigned for people who've forsaken standalone cameras for their smartphone's. The cameras wirelessly link to your smartphone (or tablet if you want) via a direct Wi-Fi connection and, with the help of Sony's PlayMemories Mobile app (for now, at least), let you use your device as a viewfinder and interface for the camera. Because of the way they look and physically attach to your smartphone, it would be easy to mistake them for some sort of  <a href="leaves/addonlens.html">add-on lens</a> that works with your smartphone's built-in camera, magically combining all the strengths of its shooter with the power of a zoom lens. There is no magic here, though, and perhaps that's what's most disappointing about the QX10.
 </p>
        <p> It's understandable why people are gobsmacked when they see the QX10. Here, in this small, lightweight cylinder, is not just a 10x zoom lens, but an entire camera. It has its own  <a href="leaves/sensorandprocessor.html">sensor and processor</a> and battery and memory card slot. All it's really missing is a screen -- which you supply with an Android or iOS smartphone or tablet -- and some controls, which you don't need since most things are handled with your device's touch screen. The need for a screen or viewfinder of some sort pretty much limits what you can do with a camera design. With no screen to deal with, you're just working the design around the lens. By going with the round body, it's not only more comfortable to hold when you're using it, but doesn't look too odd when attached to your smartphone.
