</a></h3>

        <p> To those familiar with Samsung's point-and-shoot cameras, the Samsung WB800F Smart Camera might look a whole lot like Samsung's Android-powered Galaxy Camera.The cameras share the same 21x zoom lens and  <a href="leaves/backsideilluminatedcmossensor.html">backside-illuminated CMOS sensor</a>. They also have many of the same shooting options, and the WB800F has built-in Wi-Fi for easy shooting and sharing among other things. But other than general appearance, that's pretty much where the similarities end.
 </p>
        <p> The WB800F doesn't have a SIM card slot for mobile broadband and there's  <a href="leaves/nobluetoothgpsornfc.html">no Bluetooth, GPS, or NFC;</a> it's not running on Android; and its 3-inch touch screen is dwarfed by the 4.8-inch one on the Galaxy. It is, however, considerably less expensive because of all this and the photo quality and performance are for the most part the same (actually the WB800F performs a bit better in some respects). The Samsung WB800F's picture quality is very good for its class. As usual, the more light you have, the better your photos will be, so if you're considering this primarily for daylight shooting, you'll likely be very satisfied with the results. Subjects do get noticeably softer as you increase ISO, which means with less light you'll lose sharpness and fine details, and things start to look flat. (They definitely benefit from some light post-shoot sharpening.) On the other hand, the f2.8 lens and  <a href="leaves/thebsicmossensor.html">the BSI CMOS sensor</a> keeps the camera from immediately ratcheting up ISO, so you can take low-light photos (at least at the wide end of the lens) with better results than with some competing models.
