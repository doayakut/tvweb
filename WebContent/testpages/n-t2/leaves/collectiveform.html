        <p>  The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes  collaborative modes of production and a  collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. The early modern tragedy Hamlet by Shakespeare and the classical Athenian tragedy Oedipus the King  by Sophocles are among the masterpieces of the art of drama. A modern example is Long Day's Journey into Night by Eugene Oâ€™Neill </p>
