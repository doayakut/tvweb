        <p> A novel is a long  prose narrative that describes  fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. The genre has historical roots in antiquity and medieval and early modern romance and in the tradition of the novella. The latter, an Italian word used to describe short stories, supplied the present generic English term in the 18th century. The first significant European novelist is Miguel de Cervantes, author of  Don Quixote </p>
