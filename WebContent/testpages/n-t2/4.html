    <h3><a href="4.html">Novella
</a></h3>
        <p> A novella is a written, fictional, prose narrative normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel.  <a href="leaves/novellahasalonghistory.html">Novella has a long history</a>. It is often between  <a href="leaves/20000and50000words.html">20,000 and 50,000 words</a>. The English word "novella" derives from the Italian word "novella", feminine of "novello", which means "new". The novella is a common literary genre in several  <a href="leaves/europeanlanguages.html">European languages</a>.

        <p> A novella generally features  <a href="leaves/fewerconflicts.html">fewer conflicts</a> than a novel, yet more complicated ones than a short story. The conflicts also have more time to develop than in short stories. Unlike novels, they are usually not divided into chapters, and are often intended to be read at a single sitting, as the short story, although white space is often used to divide the sections. They maintain, therefore, a single effect. Warren Cariou wrote: The novella is generally not as  <a href="leaves/formallyexperimental.html">formally experimental</a> as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with  <a href="leaves/personalandemotionaldevelopment.html">personal and emotional development</a> rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is a hallmark of the short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description
