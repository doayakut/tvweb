<h4><a href=page02.html>Boston Tech (1865â€“1916)</a></h4><div><p> Construction of the first MIT building was completed in Boston's Back Bay in 1866 and would be known as "Boston Tech" until the campus moved across the <a href="answers/CharlesRiver.html">Charles River</a> to Cambridge in 1916. MIT's financial position was severely undermined following the <a href="answers/Panicof1873.html">Panic of 1873</a> and subsequent <a href="answers/LongDepression.html">Long Depression</a>.  Enrollments decreased sharply after 1875 and by 1878, the university had abolished three professorships, reduced faculty salaries, and there was talk among members of the Corporation of closing the Institute.   In 1879, Runkle retired from a nine-year tenure as the MIT's second president trying to weather these challenges, but the board of trustees (the "MIT Corporation") was unable to secure a new successor and elected the seventy-five year-old founder William Barton Rogers back to the post in the interim under his stipulated conditions that he be allowed to resign upon the discovery of a successor and $100,000 ($2,303,000 in 2009) be raised to fund the Institute's obligations.</p><p> Because no alumni of MIT were of sufficient age to fill the position, most scientific leaders lacked executive experience, and few leaders shared the founder's, faculty's, or Corporation's vision for the young technical institute, Walker's previous experience and reputation made him uniquely qualified for the position.  Rogers wrote <a href="answers/FrancisAmasaWalker.html">Francis Amasa Walker</a> in June 1880 to offer him the Presidency.  Walker ultimately accepted in early May and was formally elected President by the MIT Corporation on May 25, 1881, however, the assassination attempt on President Garfield in July 1881 and the ensuing illness before his death in September upset Walker's transition and delayed his formal introduction to the faculty of MIT until November 5, 1881.   On May 30, 1882, during Walker's first Commencement exercises, Rogers died mid-speech where his last words were famously "bituminous coal".</p></div></div>
