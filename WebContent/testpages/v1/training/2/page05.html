<h4><a href=page05.html>Social movements and activism (1966â€“1980)</a></h4><div><p> MIT has been nominally coeducational since admitting <a href="answers/EllenSwallowRichards.html">Ellen Swallow Richards</a> in 1870. Female students, however, remained a tiny minority (numbered in dozens) prior to the completion of the first women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1964. Women constituted 43% of the undergraduates and 29% of the graduate students enrolled in 2005.  Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in environmental health.[citation needed]</p><p> However, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, intense protests by student and faculty activists against military-related research required that the MIT administration spin these laboratories off into what would become the <a href="answers/CharlesStarkDraperLaboratory.html">Charles Stark Draper Laboratory</a> and <a href="answers/LincolnLaboratory.html">Lincoln Laboratory</a>. The extent of these protests is reflected by the fact that MIT had more names on "President Nixon's enemies list" than any other single organization, among them its president Jerome Wiesner and professor Noam Chomsky. Memos revealed during Watergate indicated that Nixon had ordered MIT's federal subsidy cut "in view of Wiesner's anti-defense bias." </p><p> MIT's particular strain of anti-authoritarianism has manifested itself in other forms. In 1977, two female students, juniors Susan Gilbert and Roxanne Ritchie, were disciplined for publishing an article on April 28 of that year in the "alternative" MIT campus weekly Thursday. Entitled "<a href="answers/ConsumerGuidetoMITMen.html">Consumer Guide to MIT Men</a>," the article was a sex survey of 36 men the two claimed to have had sex with, and the men were rated according to their performance. Gilbert and Ritchie had intended to turn the tables on the rating systems and facebooks men use for women, but their article led not only to disciplinary action against them but also to a protest petition signed by 200 students, as well as condemnation by President Jerome B. Wiesner, who published a fierce criticism of the article.  Another minor campus uproar occurred when the traditional pornographic registration-day movie was replaced by Star Wars in 1984. </p><p> In 1970, the <a href="answers/thenDeanofInstituteRelationsBensonRSnyder.html">then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder</a>, published The Hidden Curriculum, in which he argued that a mass of unstated assumptions and requirements dominated MIT students' lives and inhibited their ability to function creatively. Snyder contended that these unwritten regulations, like the implicit curricula of informally compiled "course bibles" (problem sets and solutions from previous years' classes), often outweighed the effect of the "formal curriculum," and that the situation was not unique to MIT. After studying the behavior of MIT and Wellesley students, Snyder observed that "bibles" were often in fact counterproductive; they fooled professors into believing that their classes were imparting broad knowledge as intended, but instead locked professors and students into a feedback cycle to the detriment of actual education.</p></div></div>
