<h4><a href=page01.html>Burj Khalifa</a></h4><div><p> Burj Khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development that would include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including <a href="answers/TheAddressDowntownDubai.html">The Address Downtown Dubai</a>), 3 hectares (7.4 acres) of parkland, at least 19 residential towers, the <a href="answers/DubaiMall.html">Dubai Mall</a>, and the 12-hectare (30-acre) man-made Burj Khalifa Lake.</p><p> The building has returned the location of Earth's tallest freestanding structure to the Middle East, where the <a href="answers/GreatPyramidofGiza.html">Great Pyramid of Giza</a> had claimed this achievement for almost four millennia before being surpassed in 1311 by Lincoln Cathedral in England.</p><p> The decision to build Burj Khalifa is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil based economy to one that is service and tourism based. According to officials, it is necessary for projects like Burj Khalifa to be built in the city to garner more international recognition, and hence investment. "He (Sheikh <a href="answers/MohammedbinRashidAlMaktoum.html">Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum</a>) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational," said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at Nakheel Properties.</p></div></div>
