								<a href=page01.html>Chemical pulping</a>
							</h4>
							<div>
								<p>
									To make pulp from wood, a chemical pulping process separates
									lignin from cellulose fibers. This is accomplished by
									dissolving lignin in a cooking liquor, so that it may be washed
									from the cellulose fibers. This preserves the <a
										href="answers/lengthofthecellulosefibers.html">length of
										the cellulose fibers</a>. Paper made from chemical pulps are also
									known as <a href="answers/woodfreepapers.html">wood-free
										papers</a>–not to be confused with <a
										href="answers/treefreepaper.html">tree-free paper</a>. This is
									because they do not contain lignin, which deteriorates over
									time. The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper, but
									this consumes 5% of the fibers. Chemical pulping processes are
									not used to make paper made from cotton, which is already 90%
									cellulose.
								</p>
								<p>
									The microscopic structure of paper: <a
										href="answers/Micrographofpaper.html">Micrograph of paper</a>
									autofluorescing under ultraviolet illumination. The individual
									fibres in this sample are around 10 µm in diameter.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are three main chemical pulping processes. The sulfite
									process dates back to the 1840s, and it was the dominant
									process before the second world war. <a
										href="answers/Thekraftprocess.html">The kraft process</a>,
									invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s, is now the
									most commonly practiced strategy. One advantage is a chemical
									reaction with lignin produces heat, which can be used to run a
									generator. Most pulping operations using the kraft process are
									net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity
									to run an adjacent paper-mill. Another advantage is the process
									recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents. Soda
									pulping is a specialty process used to pulp straws, bagasse,
									and hardwoods with high silicate content.

								<a href=page02.html>Mechanical pulping</a>
							</h4>
							<div>
								<p>
									There are two major mechanical pulps, <a
										href="answers/thermomechanicalpulp.html">thermo mechanical
										pulp</a> (TMP) and <a href="answers/groundwoodpulp.html">groundwood
										pulp</a> (GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed
									into large steam-heated refiners where the chips are squeezed
									and made into fibres between two steel discs. In the groundwood
									process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are
									pressed against rotating stones and made into fibres.
									Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so <a
										href="answers/theyieldisveryhigh>95%.html">the yield is
										very high, >95%</a>, but also causes paper made from this pulp to
									yellow and become brittle over time. Mechanical pulps have
									rather short fibre lengths and produce weak paper. Although
									large amounts of electrical energy are required to produce
									mechanical pulp, it costs less than chemical pulp.

								<a href=page03.html>Deinked pulp</a>

							<div>
								<p>
									<a href="answers/Paperrecycling.html">Paper recycling</a>
									processes can use either chemical or mechanical pulp. By mixing
									with water and applying mechanical action the hydrogen bonds in
									the paper can be broken and fibres separated again. Most
									recycled paper contains a proportion of virgin fibre in the
									interests of quality. Generally deinked pulp is of the same
									quality or lower than the collected paper it was made from.
								</p>
								<p>There are three main classifications of recycled fibre:.</p>
								<p>
									<a href="answers/Millbrokeorinternalmillwaste.html">Mill
										broke or internal mill waste</a> – this incorporates any
									substandard or grade-change paper made within the paper mill
									which then goes back into the manufacturing system to be
									re-pulped back into paper. Such out-of-specification paper is
									not sold and is therefore often not classified as genuine
									reclaimed recycled fibre. However, most paper mills have been
									recycling their own waste fibre for many years, long before
									recycling become popular.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="answers/Preconsumerwaste.html">Preconsumer waste</a> –
									this is offcuts and processing waste, such as guillotine trims
									and envelope blank waste. This waste is generated outside the
									paper mill and could potentially go to landfill, and is a
									genuine recycled fibre source. Also includes de-inked
									preconsumer (recycled material that has been printed but did
									not reach its intended end use, such as waste from printers and
									unsold publications).
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="answers/Postconsumerwaste.html">Postconsumer waste</a>
									– this is fibre from paper which has been used for its intended
									end use and would include office waste, magazine papers and
									newsprint. As the vast majority of this paper has been printed
									(either digitally or by more conventional means such as
									lithography or rotogravure), it will either be recycled as
									printed paper or go through a deinking process first.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="answers/Recycledpapers.html">Recycled papers</a> can
									be made from 100% recycled materials or blended with virgin
									pulp. They are (generally) not as strong nor as bright as
									papers made from virgin pulp.

							<div>
								<p>
									Before the invention of continuous paper making, paper was made
									in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and
									either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mold or
									dipping and lifting the sheet mold from the vat. While still on
									the fabric in the sheet mold the wet paper is pressed to remove
									excess water and then the sheet was lifted off to be hung over
									a rope or wooden rod to air dry. In 1799, <a
										href="answers/LouisNicolasRobertofEssonnes.html">Louis-Nicolas
										Robert of Essonnes</a>, France, was granted a patent for a
									continuous paper making machine. At the time Robert was working
									for Saint-Léger Didot, with whom he quarrelled over the
									ownership of the invention. Didot thought that England was a
									better place to develop the machine. But during the troubled
									times of the <a href="answers/FrenchRevolution.html">French
										Revolution</a>, he could not go there himself, so he sent his
									brother in law, John Gamble, an Englishman living in Paris.
									Through a chain of acquaintances, Gamble was introduced to the
									brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, stationers of London, who
									agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British
									patent 2487 on 20 October 1801.
								</p>
								<p>
									With the <a href="answers/helpparticularlyofBryanDonkin.html">help
										particularly of Bryan Donkin</a>, a skilled and ingenious
									mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was
									installed at Frogmore, Hertfordshire, in 1803, followed by
									another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the
									Fourdriniers' own mill at Two Waters. The Fourdriniers also
									bought a mill at St Neots intending to install two machines
									there and the process and machines continued to develop.
								</p>
								<p>In the USA the first recorded paper machine was Gilpin's
									at Brandywine Creek, Delaware in 1817. This machine was also
									developed in England, but it was a cylinder mould machine. The
									Fourdrinier machine was introduced into the USA in 1827.</p>

								<a href=page05.html>Papermaking</a>
							</h4>
							<div>
								<p>Paper-making is known to have been traced back to China
									about 105 CE, when Cai Lun, an official attached to the
									Imperial court during the Han Dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE), created
									a sheet of paper using mulberry and other bast fibers along
									with fishnets, old rags, and hemp waste. However a recent
									archaeological discovery has been reported from Gansu province
									of paper with legible Chinese writings on it dating from 8 BCE,
									while paper had been used in China for wrapping and padding
									since the 2nd century BCE. Paper used as a writing medium
									became widespread by the 3rd century, and by the 6th century
									toilet paper was starting to be used in China as well. During
									the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) paper was folded and sewn into
									square bags to preserve the flavor of tea, while the later Song
									Dynasty (960-1279 CE) was the first government on Earth to
									issue paper-printed money.</p>
								<p>In the 8th century, paper spread to the Islamic world,
									where the rudimentary and laborious process of paper-making was
									refined and machinery was designed for bulk manufacturing of
									paper. Production began in Baghdad, where under the supervision
									of the Grand Vizier Ja'far ibn Yahya, they invented a method to
									make a thicker sheet of paper. This helped transform
									paper-making from an art into a major industry. The earliest
									use of water-powered mills in paper production, specifically
									the use of pulp mills for preparing the pulp for paper-making,
									dates back to Samarkand in the 8th century. The earliest
									references to paper mills also come from the medieval Islamic
									world, where they were first noted in the 9th century by Arabic
									geographers in Damascus. Paper-making was diffused across the
									Islamic world, from where it was diffused further west into
									Europe.</p>

								<p>The paper may then undergo sizing to alter its physical
									properties for use in various applications.</p>
								<p>
									Paper at this point is uncoated. Coated paper has a thin layer
									of material such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to
									one or both sides in order to create a surface more suitable
									for high-resolution halftone screens. (Uncoated papers are
									rarely suitable for screens above 150 lpi.) <a
										href="answers/Coatedoruncoatedpapers.html">Coated or
										uncoated papers</a> may have their surfaces polished by
									calendering. Coated papers are divided into matte, semi-matte
									or silk, and gloss. Gloss papers give the highest optical
									density in the printed image.
								</p>
								<p>The paper is then fed onto reels if it is to be used on
									web printing presses, or cut into sheets for other printing
									processes or other purposes. The fibres in the paper basically
									run in the machine direction. Sheets are usually cut
									"long-grain", i.e. with the grain parallel to the longer
									dimension of the sheet.</p>
								<p>
									All paper produced by paper machines as the <a
										href="answers/FourdrinierMachine.html">Fourdrinier Machine</a>
									are wove paper, i.e. the wire mesh that transports the web
									leaves a pattern that has the same density along the paper
									grain and across the grain. Textured finishes, watermarks and
									wire patterns imitating hand-made laid paper can be created by
									the use of appropriate rollers in the later stages of the
									machine.
								</p>
								<p>
									Wove paper does not exhibit "<a href="answers/laidlines.html">laidlines</a>",
									which are small regular lines left behind on paper when it was
									handmade in a mould made from rows of metal wires or bamboo.
									Laidlines are very close together. They run perpendicular to
									the "<a href="answers/chainlines.html">chainlines</a>", which
									are further apart. Handmade paper similarly exhibits "<a
										href="answers/deckleedges.html">deckle edges</a>", or rough
									and feathery borders.
