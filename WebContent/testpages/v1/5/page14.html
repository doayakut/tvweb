<h4><a href=page14.html>Rayon</a></h4><div><p> Rayon is a manufactured <a href="answers/regeneratedcellulosefiber.html">regenerated cellulose fiber</a>. It is made from purified cellulose, primarily from wood pulp, which is chemically converted into a soluble compound. <a href="answers/FedsclaimanothertypeoffabricisRayon.html">Feds claim another type of fabric is Rayon</a>. It is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments which are chemically solidified, resulting in fibers of nearly pure cellulose. Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers, it is considered a semi-synthetic fiber. Specific types of rayon include viscose, modal and lyocell, each of which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product. Some <a href="answers/majorrayon.html">major rayon</a> fiber uses include apparel (e.g. Aloha shirts, blouses, dresses, jackets, lingerie, linings, scarves, suits, neckties, hats, socks), the filling in <a href="answers/Zippolighters.html">Zippo lighters</a>, furnishings (e.g. bedspreads, bedsheets, blankets, window treatments, upholstery, slipcovers), industrial uses (e.g. medical surgery products, non-woven products, tire cord), and other uses (e.g. yarn, feminine hygiene products, diapers, towels). Rayon is a major feedstock in the production of carbon fiber.</p><p> Finally, in 1894, English chemist Charles Frederick Cross, and his collaborators <a href="answers/EdwardJohnBevan.html">Edward John Bevan</a>, and Clayton Beadle patented their artificial silk, which they named “viscose”, because the reaction product of carbon disulfide and cellulose in basic conditions gave a highly viscous solution of xanthate. The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the UK company Courtaulds Fibers in 1905. Avtex Fibers Incorporated began selling their formulation in the United States in 1910. The name “rayon” was adopted in 1924, with “viscose” being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane. In Europe, though, the fabric itself became known as “viscose,” which has been ruled an acceptable alternative term for rayon by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p><p> The method is able to use wood (cellulose and lignin) as a source of cellulose while the other methods need lignin-free cellulose as starting material. This makes it cheaper and therefore it was used on a larger scale than the other methods. Contamination of the waste water by carbon disulfide, lignin and the xanthates made this process detrimental to the environment. Rayon was only produced as a filament fiber until the 1930s when it was discovered that broken waste rayon could be used in staple fiber. The physical properties of rayon were unchanged until the development of high-tenacity rayon in the 1940s. Further research and development led to the creation of high-wet-modulus rayon (HWM rayon) in the 1950s.[7] Research in the UK was centred on the government-funded British Rayon Research Association.</p><p> Rayon is a versatile fiber and has the same comfort properties as natural fibers. It can imitate the feel and texture of silk, wool, cotton and linen. The fibers are easily dyed in a wide range of colors. Rayon fabrics are soft, smooth, cool, comfortable, and highly absorbent, but they do not insulate body heat, making them ideal for use in hot and humid climates.[8]The durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayon are low, especially when wet; also, rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber. However, HWM rayon (high-wet-modulus rayon) is much stronger and exhibits higher durability and appearance retention. Recommended care for regular viscose rayon is dry-cleaning only. HWM rayon can be machine washed.[7]</p><p> Regular rayon has lengthwise lines called striations and its cross-section is an indented circular shape. The cross-sections of HWM and cupra rayon are rounder. Filament rayon yarns vary from 80 to 980 filaments per yarn and vary in size from 40 to 5000 denier. Staple fibers range from 1.5 to 15 denier and are mechanically or chemically crimped. Rayon fibers are naturally very bright, but the addition of delustering pigments cuts down on this natural brightness.[7]</p></div></div>
