<h4><a href=page07.html>Kodak EasyShare Z5010</a></h4><div><p> The Kodak EasyShare Z5010 is a good example of what Kodak did best with its digital cameras. Instead of going after the entire market, Kodak concentrated on making cameras that were easy to use and a good value, and that's the Z5010 all over. It's <a href="answers/abasicpointandshoot.html">a basic point-and-shoot</a>, but still has a manual mode for shutter speed and aperture control, with a 21x zoom lens, a 3-inch LCD, and AA batteries for power. It also has Kodak's Share button, which lets you easily tag photos and video clips for quick uploading to sharing sites, e-mailing, or sending to Kodak's Pulse picture frames when the camera's connected to a computer.</p><p> However, the Z5010's photos are just a step above what you'd get from a good smartphone and its shooting performance is fairly slow -- both typical for this class of camera. And the Z5010 feels like <a href="answers/anentrylevelcamera.html">an entry-level camera</a>, too. Then again, you do get a nice wide and long lens and it's priced to move; you can find it for about $100 less than its original $199.95 price. The Kodak EasyShare Z5010 is capable of taking some very good photos, but it is not without limitations. Basically, if you view its <a href="answers/14megapixelpictures.html">14-megapixel pictures</a> at larger sizes, 80 to 100 percent, you'll see a good deal of noise and artifacts, and subjects look soft and lack fine detail. That's even at its lowest sensitivity of ISO 64. This is only really a problem if you frequently enlarge and heavily crop your photos or are making prints larger than 8x10. At smaller screen and print sizes, photos taken with plenty of light look good.</p><p> The results drop off considerably <a href="answers/asyougoaboveISO400.html">as you go above ISO 400</a>, which is typical for this class of camera. I wouldn't recommend this camera for regularly taking low-light photos without a flash or with the lens extended indoors. But again, outside with good light you'll get good results. (Read more about the camera's image quality and full-size photos in the slideshow above.) Movie quality is good enough for posting online, but not great at larger sizes. Clips are limited to 10 minutes in length. The zoom lens on my review camera did function while recording video, and its movement was fairly silent. The continuous autofocus is reasonably quick to focus, but it really depends on lighting, subject, and focal length (the more zoomed in it is and the less light you have, the longer it may take).</p><p> If you want to take a little more control, there is a Program mode in which you can change white balance, ISO, focus, exposure, and metering, and a Manual mode that adds control over shutter speed and aperture. Kodak makes it pretty easy to change the settings, too, by laying them out in a bar at the bottom of the LCD. There are no settings for manual white balance or manual focus, though. The Kodak EasyShare Z5010 is more than likely the last Kodak camera I'll review, at least until someone decides to license the brand. Like all of the EasyShare models I've reviewed before it, the Z5010 is <a href="answers/anexcellentvalue.html">an excellent value</a> with nice features and simple operation. Unfortunately, to go with its low price, the quality of the camera and its pictures aren't the greatest. But if you're a casual photographer who makes small prints and shares photos online, and wants a long lens and a camera that uses AA batteries for power, I'd pick one up before it's gone.</p><p> </p></div></div>
