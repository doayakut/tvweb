<h4><a href=page06.html>Bream</a></h4><div><p> This high-valued species is the favored <a href="answers/seabream.html">sea bream</a>, prized in Mediterranean cuisine and highly regarded by European chefs. It gets the “gilt-head” name from the golden stripe between its eyes. The Romans reportedly called the bream “Aurata,” the gilded one. The Greek goddess Aphrodite also considered the gilt-head bream sacred. The fish reach maturity during their second year, up to which time they are male. In the third year, for reasons not fully understood, they become female. Sea bream are found in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, but commercial harvests are small. As with European sea bass, bream is increasingly supplied by aquaculture operations, mostly in the Mediterranean. Some is also raised in Iceland in geothermic water. A small member of the <a href="answers/porgyfamily.html">porgy family</a>, Sparidae, sea bream usually run 10 to 14 inches long and between 1 1/4 and 6 pounds. Upscale chefs in the United States menu <a href="answers/breambyitsFrenchname.html">bream by its French name</a>, daurade, or daurade royale.</p><p> The <a href="answers/rosycoloredrawmeat.html">rosy-colored raw meat</a> turns white when cooked. Bream’s moist flesh has a rich, sweet flavor. The texture is firm but tender. Daurade is best cooked whole, dressed but with the backbone left in. Because the flesh holds together well, it can be braised and used in stews. It is the fish traditionally featured in bouillabaisse. The fish is excellent poached in wine. It can also be stuffed and baked, grilled or sautéed. A lesser bream, Pagellus bogaraveo, or red bream, is known by the <a href="answers/Frenchnamedoradecommunue.html">French name dorade communue</a>; don’t confuse it with the superior daurade royale, Sparus auratus.</p><p> The bream is usually 30 to 55 cm (12 to 22 in) long, though some specimens of 75 cm (30 in) have been recorded; it usually weighs 2 to 4 kg (4.4 to 8.8 lb). The maximum length is 90 cm (35.5 in) with a maximum recorded weight of about 9.1 kg (20 lb). It has a laterally flattened and high-backed body and a slightly undershot mouth. It is a silvery grey colour, though older fish can be bronze-coloured especially in clear waters. The fins are greyish to black, but never reddish. The common bream can easily be confused with the silver or white bream (Blicca bjoerkna), in particular at the younger stages (see picture). The most reliable method of distinguishing these species is by counting the scales in a straight line downwards from the first ray of the dorsal fin to the lateral line. Silver bream have fewer than 10 rows of scales, while common bream have 11 or more. At the adult stage the reddish tint of the pectoral fin of the silver bream is diagnostic. Like other Cyprinidae, common bream can easily hybridise with other species, and hybrids with roach (Rutilus rutilus) can be very difficult to distinguish from pure-bred bream.[2]</p><p> The common bream lives in schools near the bottom. At night common bream can feed close to the shore and in clear waters with sandy bottoms feeding pits can be seen during daytime. The fish’s protractile mouth helps it dig for chironomid larvae, Tubifex worms, bivalves, and gastropods. The bream eats water plants and plankton, as well. In very turbid waters, common bream can occur in large numbers, which may result in a shortage of bottom-living prey such as chironomids. The bream are then forced to live by filter feeding with their gill rakers, Daphnia water fleas being the main prey. As the fish grows, the gill rakers become too far apart to catch small prey and the bream will not then grow bigger than 40 cm (16 in).[citation needed] If a common bream is malnourished, it can develop a so-called “knife back”, a sharp edge along its back.</p></div></div>
