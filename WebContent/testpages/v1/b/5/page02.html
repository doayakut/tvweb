<h4><a href=page02.html>Khaki</a></h4><div><p> Khaki is a color, a light shade of yellow-brown similar to tan or beige.  It has been used by many armies around the world for uniforms, including camouflage. It has been used as a color name in English since 1848. <a href="answers/ArmedServiceannouncesthecancellationofKhakiasservicedress.html">Armed Service announces the cancellation of Khaki as service dress</a> .In Western fashion, it is a standard color for smart casual dress trousers for civilians. However, the name is sometimes also used to describe a drab green color. In the mid-twentieth century as many Western militaries adopted an olive drab instead of the older, more brownish khaki, the two color names became associated with each other. In French, and German, for example, “khaki” refers to a much darker olive drab-style military green. In 1846 Sir Harry Lumsden raised a Corps of Guides for frontier service from British Indian recruits at Peshawar. <a href="answers/Lumsden.html">Lumsden</a> was of the view that the border troops were best dressed in their native costume, which consisted of a smock and white pajama trousers made of a coarse home-spun cotton, and a cotton turban, supplemented by a leather or padded cotton jacket for cold weather. For the first year, no attempt was made at uniformity. Subsequently, the material was dyed locally with a dye prepared from the native mazari palm. This created a drab gray which was used historically by Afghan tribals for camouflaging themselves. However, mazari could not dye leather jackets, and an alternative was sought. Cloth was dyed in mulberry juice which gave a yellowish drab shade. Subsequently all regiments, whether British or Indian, serving in the region had adopted properly dyed khaki uniforms for active service and summer dress. <a href="answers/Theoriginalkhaki.html">The original khaki</a> fabric was a closely twilled cloth of linen or cotton.</p><p> <a href="answers/DuringtheSecondBoerWar.html">During the Second Boer War</a>, the British forces became known as Khakis because of their uniforms. After victory in the war the government called an election, which became known as the khaki election, a term used subsequently for elections called to exploit public approval of governments immediately after victories. The United States Army adopted khaki during the Spanish American War (1898).</p><p> Khaki-colored uniforms were used officially by British troops for the first time during the Abyssinian campaign of 1867–68, when Indian troops traveled to Ethiopia (Abyssinia) under the command of general Sir Robert Napier to release some British captives and to “persuade the Abyssinian King Theodore, forcibly if necessary, to mend his ways”.[5] Subsequently, the British Army adopted khaki for colonial campaign dress and it was used in the Mahdist War (1884-1889) and Second Boer War (1899–1902). During the Second Boer War, the British forces became known as Khakis because of their uniforms. After victory in the war the government called an election, which became known as the khaki election, a term used subsequently for elections called to exploit public approval of governments immediately after victories.</p><p> Khaki is a common color in military uniforms, as on these students from the Philippines Merchant Marine Academy. The United States Army adopted khaki during the Spanish American War (1898). The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps followed suit. During the second half of the WWII, American olive drab became distinctly more green, known as olive green. Most of the countries that participated in NATO, adopted the US military style and with it the olive green color. This color continued to be called khaki in many European countries. In France for example the term passed in the general language for a green shade of olive color. The older yellow-brown used in WWI was called in France moutarde instead. When khaki was adopted for the continental British Service Dress in 1902, the shade chosen had a clearly darker and more green hue. This color was adopted with minor variations by all the British Empire Armies and the US expeditionary force of World War I, in the latter under the name olive drab. This shade of brown-green remained in use by many countries throughout the two World Wars.</p></div></div>
