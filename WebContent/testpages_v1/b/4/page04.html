<h4><a href=page04.html>Tilefish</a></h4><div><p> <a href="answers/Thecolorfultilefish.html">The colorful tilefish</a>, known as the “clown of the sea,” may look like a tropical species, but it is found from Florida to as far north as Nova Scotia. Tilefish inhabit a narrow stretch of ocean floor in a band of warm water along the upper reaches of the continental slope. The major fishing grounds are off eastern Florida, southern New Jersey and the tip of Long Island, N.Y. <a href="answers/Fishermentargettilefishwithlonglines.html">Fishermen target tilefish with longlines</a>; it is a selective fishery with little bycatch. Whether from Miami or Montauk, almost <a href="answers/alltilefishissoldfresh.html">all tilefish is sold fresh</a>, graded and priced by size: The bigger the fish, the higher the per-pound price. But just because smaller tilefish are less expensive than large ones, that doesn’t mean you’ve got a bargain. The smaller fish have a shorter shelf life, and their flesh tends to be softer. Tilefish can grow up to 4 feet and 80 pounds, although 5 to 10 pounds are average in the commercial catch. Fish from deeper waters dine primarily on crabs, giving them a firmer texture and sweeter flavor than those harvested in shallower waters.</p><p> This species is sometimes called <a href="answers/therainbowtilefish.html">the rainbow tilefish</a> for its lovely blue, green, rose and yellow coloration. Out of the water, the colors fade. Tilefish yield thick fillets with a row of pinbones. <a href="answers/Therawmeatispinkishwhite.html">The raw meat is pinkish-white</a> but cooks up white with a firm, flaky texture. The flavor is mild but distinctive, often compared to lobster or crab, which is not surprising, since the tilefish’s diet is largely crustaceans. Because tilefish contain high levels of methylmercury, the FDA advises pregnant and nursing women, women of childbearing age and young children to avoid eating tilefish meat.</p><p> The two subfamilies appear to be morphologically different, with members of Branchiosteginae having deep bodies, large heads, and large, somewhat subterminal mouths. In contrast, members of Malacanthinae are slender with elongated bodies, smaller heads, and terminal mouths.</p><p> Tilefish range in size from 11 cm (yellow tilefish, Hoplolatilus luteus) to 125 cm (great northern tilefish, Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps) and a weight of 30 kg. Both subfamilies have long dorsal and anal fins, the latter having one or two spines. The gill covers (opercula) have one spine which may be sharp or blunt; some species also have a cutaneous ridge atop the head. The tail fin may range in shape from truncated to forked. Most species are fairly low-key in colour, commonly shades of yellow, brown, and gray. Notable exceptions include three small, vibrant Hoplolatilus species: the purple sand tilefish (H. purpureus), Starck’s tilefish (H. starcki) and the redback sand tilefish (H. marcosi).</p><p> Tilefish larvae are notable for their generous complement of spines and serrations on the head and scales. This feature also explains the family name Malacanthidae, from the Greek words mala meaning “many” and akantha meaning “thorn”. Generally shallow-water fish, tilefish are usually found at depths of 50–200 m in both temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. All species seek shelter in self-made burrows, caves at the bases of reefs, or piles of rock, often in canyons or at the edges of steep slopes. Either gravelly or sandy substrate may be preferred, depending on the species. Most species are strictly marine; an exception is found in the blue blanquillo (Malacanthus latovittatus) which is known to enter the brackish waters of Papua New Guinea’s Goldie River. Tilefish feed primarily on small benthic invertebrates, especially crustaceans such as crab and shrimp. Mollusks, worms, sea urchins and small fish are also taken.</p></div></div>
