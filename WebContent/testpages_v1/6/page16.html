<h4><a href=page16.html>Sony Cyber-shot QX10</a></h4><div><p> You have to give Sony credit for trying something new to stem declining point-and-shoot sales. The Cyber-shot DSC-QX10 and its <a href="answers/higherendlinematetheQX100.html">higher-end linemate, the QX100</a>, are essentially compact cameras redesigned for people who've forsaken standalone cameras for their smartphone's. The cameras wirelessly link to your smartphone (or tablet if you want) via a direct Wi-Fi connection and, with the help of Sony's PlayMemories Mobile app (for now, at least), let you use your device as a viewfinder and interface for the camera. Because of the way they look and physically attach to your smartphone, it would be easy to mistake them for some sort of <a href="answers/addonlens.html">add-on lens</a> that works with your smartphone's built-in camera, magically combining all the strengths of its shooter with the power of a zoom lens. There is no magic here, though, and perhaps that's what's most disappointing about the QX10.</p><p> It's understandable why people are gobsmacked when they see the QX10. Here, in this small, lightweight cylinder, is not just a 10x zoom lens, but an entire camera. It has its own <a href="answers/sensorandprocessor.html">sensor and processor</a> and battery and memory card slot. All it's really missing is a screen -- which you supply with an Android or iOS smartphone or tablet -- and some controls, which you don't need since most things are handled with your device's touch screen. The need for a screen or viewfinder of some sort pretty much limits what you can do with a camera design. With no screen to deal with, you're just working the design around the lens. By going with the round body, it's not only more comfortable to hold when you're using it, but doesn't look too odd when attached to your smartphone.</p><p> By lesser version, I mean that the controls and features have been streamlined to just the essentials so shooting and sharing is as easy as possible. The <a href="answers/camerasphysicalcontrols.html">camera's physical controls</a> are limited to a power button on top that's flush with the body and a shutter release and zoom rocker on the right side. Once the camera is mounted on your smartphone, the controls can be difficult to find by touch until you get used to their placement. A removable tension clip twists and locks onto the back of the camera and is what's used to physically attach the QX10 to your smartphone. Beyond the clip, which does strongly grip your device, there is nothing else securing them to each other.</p><p> Video quality is good, but nothing special. The camera records MP4 files for easier playback, editing, and uploading on mobile devices. The resolution is 1,440x1,080p at 30 frames per second, so it's not technically "<a href="answers/fullHD.html">full HD</a>." It is fine for online sharing and viewing on mobile devices and, as with pictures, video benefits from having the optical image stabilization. If recording in full HD matters to you, you'll have to get one of Sony's other Cyber-shots, but even then you'll be recording in AVCHD (MTS) and not MP4. The Sony Cyber-shot QX10 makes a bit more sense that its linemate, the QX100. It's smaller, less expensive, and designed more for casual photographers who want some zoom range to supplement their smartphone photography. A regular point-and-shoot with built-in Wi-Fi is a better option, but if you're looking for something different than the standard pocket camera, it's worth at least trying one out. That said, it's still a second device and if you're already not willing to carry around something in addition to your phone, don't bother.</p></div></div>
