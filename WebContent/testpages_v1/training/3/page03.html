<h4><a href=page03.html>KVLY-TV mast</a></h4><div><p> The KVLY-TV mast (formerly the KTHI-TV mast) is a 2,063 ft (628.8 m) tall television-transmitting mast in <a href="answers/BlanchardTraillCountyNorthDakota.html">Blanchard, Traill County, North Dakota</a>, United States, used by Fargo station <a href="answers/KVLYTV.html">KVLY-TV</a> channel 11|. Completed in 1963, it was the tallest structure ever built until succeeded by the Warsaw radio mast in 1974; that mast collapsed in 1991, making the KVLY-TV mast again the tallest structure in the world until the Burj Khalifa overtook it in 2010. It remains the <a href="answers/thirdtalleststructure.html">third-tallest structure</a> in the world (since the construction of the Tokyo Skytree), and the tallest structure in the western hemisphere. It is a guyed mast, not a self-supporting structure, and is therefore not included in lists of tallest buildings. The height of the transmitting antenna itself is 113 feet (34 m) and is included in the height of the tower as the lattice tower itself ends around 1,950 feet (590 m). The tower weighs 864,500 pounds (392.1 t) altogether and takes up 160 acres (0.65 km2) of land with its guy anchors.[] The 113-foot antenna alone weighs 9,000 pounds. In 1989, daredevils climbed the tower and BASE jumped from it.</p><p> The tower is located 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Blanchard, North Dakota, halfway between Fargo and Grand Forks. It became the tallest artificial structure, and the first man-made structure to exceed 2,000 feet (610 m) in height, upon the completion of its construction on August 13, 1963.</p><p> The tower was built by Hamilton Erection Company of York, South Carolina and Kline Iron and Steel, and took thirty days to complete, at a cost of US$500,000.</p><p> Owned by Hoak Media of Dallas, Texas, the tower broadcasts at 356 kW on Channel 44 for television station KVLY-TV (channel 11 PSIP, an NBC affiliate) which is based in Fargo. The tower provides a broadcast area of roughly 9,700 sq mi (25,000 km2) which is a radius of about 55.6 miles (89.5 km).</p></div></div>
