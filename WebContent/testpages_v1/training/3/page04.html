<h4><a href=page04.html>Abraj Al Bait</a></h4><div><p> The Abraj Al-Bait Towers, also known as the <a href="answers/MeccaRoyalHotelClockTower.html">Mecca Royal Hotel Clock Tower</a>, is a building complex in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. These towers are a part of the King Abdulaziz Endowment Project that strives to modernize the city in catering to its pilgrims. The complex holds several world records, the tallest clock tower in the world and the world's largest clock face. The complex's hotel tower became the third tallest building in the world in 2012, surpassing Taiwan's Taipei 101 and surpassed only by Dubai's Burj Khalifa and Shanghai's Shanghai Tower. The building complex is metres away from <a href="answers/theworldslargestmosque.html">the world's largest mosque</a> and Islam's most sacred site, the Masjid al-Haram. The developer and contractor of the complex is the Saudi Binladin Group, the Kingdom's largest construction company. The complex was built after the demolition of the <a href="answers/AjyadFortress.html">Ajyad Fortress</a>, the 18th century Ottoman citadel which stood atop a hill overlooking the Grand Mosque. The destruction of the fort in 2002 by the Saudi government sparked Turkish and international outcry.</p><p> The tallest tower in the complex stands as the tallest building in Saudi Arabia, with a height of 601 metres (1,972 feet). Currently it is the third tallest freestanding structure in the world, surpassing Taipei 101 in <a href="answers/TaipeiTaiwan.html">Taipei, Taiwan</a>. The structure had surpassed Dubai International Airport in having the largest floor area of any structure in the world with 1,500,000 m2 (16,150,000 sq ft) of floorspace, but is now second, after the 1,700,000 m2 (18,300,000 sq ft) New Century Global Centre in Chengdu, China.</p><p> </p></div></div>
