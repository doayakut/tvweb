<h4><a href=page06.html>Finishing</a></h4><div><p> The paper may then undergo sizing to alter its physical properties for use in various applications.</p><p> Paper at this point is uncoated. Coated paper has a thin layer of material such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to one or both sides in order to create a surface more suitable for high-resolution halftone screens. (Uncoated papers are rarely suitable for screens above 150 lpi.) <a href="answers/Coatedoruncoatedpapers.html">Coated or uncoated papers</a> may have their surfaces polished by calendering. Coated papers are divided into matte, semi-matte or silk, and gloss. Gloss papers give the highest optical density in the printed image.</p><p> The paper is then fed onto reels if it is to be used on web printing presses, or cut into sheets for other printing processes or other purposes. The fibres in the paper basically run in the machine direction. Sheets are usually cut "long-grain", i.e. with the grain parallel to the longer dimension of the sheet.</p><p> All paper produced by paper machines as the <a href="answers/FourdrinierMachine.html">Fourdrinier Machine</a> are wove paper, i.e. the wire mesh that transports the web leaves a pattern that has the same density along the paper grain and across the grain. Textured finishes, watermarks and wire patterns imitating hand-made laid paper can be created by the use of appropriate rollers in the later stages of the machine.</p><p> Wove paper does not exhibit "<a href="answers/laidlines.html">laidlines</a>", which are small regular lines left behind on paper when it was handmade in a mould made from rows of metal wires or bamboo. Laidlines are very close together. They run perpendicular to the "<a href="answers/chainlines.html">chainlines</a>", which are further apart. Handmade paper similarly exhibits "<a href="answers/deckleedges.html">deckle edges</a>", or rough and feathery borders. </p></div></div>
