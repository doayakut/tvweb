<h4><a href=page01.html>Chemical pulping</a></h4><div><p> To make pulp from wood, a chemical pulping process separates lignin from cellulose fibers. This is accomplished by dissolving lignin in a cooking liquor, so that it may be washed from the cellulose fibers. This preserves the <a href="answers/lengthofthecellulosefibers.html">length of the cellulose fibers</a>. Paper made from chemical pulps are also known as <a href="answers/woodfreepapers.html">wood-free papers</a>–not to be confused with <a href="answers/treefreepaper.html">tree-free paper</a>. This is because they do not contain lignin, which deteriorates over time. The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper, but this consumes 5% of the fibers. Chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton, which is already 90% cellulose.</p><p> The microscopic structure of paper: <a href="answers/Micrographofpaper.html">Micrograph of paper</a> autofluorescing under ultraviolet illumination. The individual fibres in this sample are around 10 µm in diameter.</p><p> There are three main chemical pulping processes. The sulfite process dates back to the 1840s, and it was the dominant process before the second world war. <a href="answers/Thekraftprocess.html">The kraft process</a>, invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s, is now the most commonly practiced strategy. One advantage is a chemical reaction with lignin produces heat, which can be used to run a generator. Most pulping operations using the kraft process are net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity to run an adjacent paper-mill. Another advantage is the process recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents. Soda pulping is a specialty process used to pulp straws, bagasse, and hardwoods with high silicate content.</p></div></div>
