<h4><a href=page03.html>Deinked pulp</a></h4><div><p> <a href="answers/Paperrecycling.html">Paper recycling</a> processes can use either chemical or mechanical pulp. By mixing with water and applying mechanical action the hydrogen bonds in the paper can be broken and fibres separated again. Most recycled paper contains a proportion of virgin fibre in the interests of quality. Generally deinked pulp is of the same quality or lower than the collected paper it was made from.</p><p> There are three main classifications of recycled fibre:.</p><p> <a href="answers/Millbrokeorinternalmillwaste.html">Mill broke or internal mill waste</a> – this incorporates any substandard or grade-change paper made within the paper mill which then goes back into the manufacturing system to be re-pulped back into paper. Such out-of-specification paper is not sold and is therefore often not classified as genuine reclaimed recycled fibre. However, most paper mills have been recycling their own waste fibre for many years, long before recycling become popular.</p><p> <a href="answers/Preconsumerwaste.html">Preconsumer waste</a> – this is offcuts and processing waste, such as guillotine trims and envelope blank waste. This waste is generated outside the paper mill and could potentially go to landfill, and is a genuine recycled fibre source. Also includes de-inked preconsumer (recycled material that has been printed but did not reach its intended end use, such as waste from printers and unsold publications). </p><p> <a href="answers/Postconsumerwaste.html">Postconsumer waste</a> – this is fibre from paper which has been used for its intended end use and would include office waste, magazine papers and newsprint. As the vast majority of this paper has been printed (either digitally or by more conventional means such as lithography or rotogravure), it will either be recycled as printed paper or go through a deinking process first.</p><p> <a href="answers/Recycledpapers.html">Recycled papers</a> can be made from 100% recycled materials or blended with virgin pulp. They are (generally) not as strong nor as bright as papers made from virgin pulp.</p></div></div>
