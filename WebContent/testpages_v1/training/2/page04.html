<h4><a href=page04.html>World War Two and Cold War (1940â€“1966)</a></h4><div><p> MIT was drastically changed by its involvement in military research during World War Two. Bush, who had been MIT's Vice President (effectively Provost) was appointed head of the <a href="answers/OfficeofScientificResearchandDevelopment.html">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> which was responsible for the Manhattan Project. Government-sponsored research had contributed to a fantastic growth in the size of the Institute's research staff and physical plant as well as a shifting the educational focus away from undergraduates to graduate studies.</p><p> During World War II, MIT was one of <a href="answers/131colleges.html">131 colleges</a> and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.</p><p> As the Cold War and Space Race intensified and concerns about the technology gap between the U.S. and the Soviet Union grew more pervasive throughout the 1950s and 1960s, MIT's involvement in the military-industrial complex was a source of pride on campus.[citation needed] <a href="answers/MITsDepartmentofNuclearEngineering.html">MIT's Department of Nuclear Engineering</a> as well as the Center for International Studies were established in 1957.</p><p> <a href="answers/WalkersCourseIXonGeneralStudies.html">Walker's Course IX on General Studies</a> was dissolved shortly after his death and a seventy-year debate followed over what was the appropriate role and scope of humanistic and social studies at MIT.  A new Department of Economics, Statistics, and Political Science was established in 1903 to replace Course IX, which was later split into a Department of Economics and Statistics and a Department of History of Political Science in 1907.  <a href="answers/KarlTaylorCompton.html">Karl Taylor Compton</a> reorganized the Institute to incorporate a Division of Humanities under which these departments were placed in 1932, but could offer no degrees. Between 1918 and 1956, political science classes and faculty were subsumed or merged into any of History and English or Economics and Social Science until a separate Ph.D. program was approved in 1958.  A PhD program in Economics was launched in 1941.</p><p> The 1949 report of the Committee on Educational Survey recommended the establishment of a School of Humanities granting degrees which led to the establishment of the same in 1950 and separate departments in Economics and Political Science were formally established in 1965. Since 1975, all MIT undergraduate students have been required to take eight classes distributed across the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences before receiving their degrees.</p></div></div>
