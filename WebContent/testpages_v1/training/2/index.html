<div style="margin-top: 2em;">
<h4><a href=page01.html>Beginnings</a></h4><div><p> As early as 1859, the Massachusetts State Legislature was given a proposal for use of newly opened lands in <a href="answers/BackBay.html">Back Bay</a> in Boston for a museum and Conservatory of Art and Science.</p><p> On April 10, 1861, the governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts signed a charter for the incorporation of the "Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston Society of Natural History" which had been submitted by <a href="answers/WilliamBartonRogers.html">William Barton Rogers</a>. Rogers sought to establish a new form of higher education to address the challenges posed by rapid advances in science and technology in the mid-19th century, that he believed classic institutions were ill-prepared to deal with.</p><p> With the charter approved, Rogers began raising funds, developing a curriculum and looking for a suitable location. The Rogers Plan, as it came to be known, was rooted in three principles: the educational value of useful knowledge, the necessity of “learning by doing,” and integrating a professional and liberal arts education at the undergraduate level. MIT was a pioneer in the use of laboratory instruction. Its founding philosophy is "the teaching, not of the manipulations and minute details of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of all the scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them;"</p><p> Because open conflict in the <a href="answers/CivilWar.html">Civil War</a> broke out only two days later on April 12, 1861, Rogers faced enormous difficulties raising funds to match conditional financial commitments from the state. Thus, his recruitment of faculty and students was delayed, but eventually MIT's first classes were held in rented space at the Mercantile Building in downtown Boston in 1865</p></div></div>
<div style="margin-top: 2em;">
<h4><a href=page02.html>Boston Tech (1865–1916)</a></h4><div><p> Construction of the first MIT building was completed in Boston's Back Bay in 1866 and would be known as "Boston Tech" until the campus moved across the <a href="answers/CharlesRiver.html">Charles River</a> to Cambridge in 1916. MIT's financial position was severely undermined following the <a href="answers/Panicof1873.html">Panic of 1873</a> and subsequent <a href="answers/LongDepression.html">Long Depression</a>.  Enrollments decreased sharply after 1875 and by 1878, the university had abolished three professorships, reduced faculty salaries, and there was talk among members of the Corporation of closing the Institute.   In 1879, Runkle retired from a nine-year tenure as the MIT's second president trying to weather these challenges, but the board of trustees (the "MIT Corporation") was unable to secure a new successor and elected the seventy-five year-old founder William Barton Rogers back to the post in the interim under his stipulated conditions that he be allowed to resign upon the discovery of a successor and $100,000 ($2,303,000 in 2009) be raised to fund the Institute's obligations.</p><p> Because no alumni of MIT were of sufficient age to fill the position, most scientific leaders lacked executive experience, and few leaders shared the founder's, faculty's, or Corporation's vision for the young technical institute, Walker's previous experience and reputation made him uniquely qualified for the position.  Rogers wrote <a href="answers/FrancisAmasaWalker.html">Francis Amasa Walker</a> in June 1880 to offer him the Presidency.  Walker ultimately accepted in early May and was formally elected President by the MIT Corporation on May 25, 1881, however, the assassination attempt on President Garfield in July 1881 and the ensuing illness before his death in September upset Walker's transition and delayed his formal introduction to the faculty of MIT until November 5, 1881.   On May 30, 1882, during Walker's first Commencement exercises, Rogers died mid-speech where his last words were famously "bituminous coal".</p></div></div>
<div style="margin-top: 2em;">
<h4><a href=page03.html>Cambridge campus and interwar years (1916–1940)</a></h4><div><p> These attempted mergers occurred in parallel with MITs continued expansion beyond the classroom and laboratory space permitted by its building in Boston. President <a href="answers/RichardMaclaurin.html">Richard Maclaurin</a> sought to move the campus to a new location when he took office in 1909.  An anonymous donor, later revealed to be <a href="answers/GeorgeEastman.html">George Eastman</a>, donated the funds to buy a mile-long tract of swamp and industrial land along the Cambridge side of the Charles River. A distinct new era in MIT's history began when it moved into its new Cambridge campus in 1916. Designed by William Welles Bosworth, who had made a name for himself in designing the AT\&T headquarters in New York City,  the new campus fomented some changes in the stagnating undergraduate curriculum. In the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President Vannevar Bush drastically reformed the curricula by reemphasizing the importance of "pure" sciences like physics and chemistry and reducing the work required in shops and drafting. Despite the difficulties of the <a href="answers/GreatDepression.html">Great Depression</a>, the reforms "renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering."  More fortuitously, they also cemented MIT's academic reputation on the eve of World War II by attracting scientists and researchers who would later make significant contributions in the <a href="answers/RadiationLaboratory.html">Radiation Laboratory</a>, Instrumentation Laboratory, and other defense-related research programs.</p></div></div>
<div style="margin-top: 2em;">
<h4><a href=page04.html>World War Two and Cold War (1940–1966)</a></h4><div><p> MIT was drastically changed by its involvement in military research during World War Two. Bush, who had been MIT's Vice President (effectively Provost) was appointed head of the <a href="answers/OfficeofScientificResearchandDevelopment.html">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> which was responsible for the Manhattan Project. Government-sponsored research had contributed to a fantastic growth in the size of the Institute's research staff and physical plant as well as a shifting the educational focus away from undergraduates to graduate studies.</p><p> During World War II, MIT was one of <a href="answers/131colleges.html">131 colleges</a> and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.</p><p> As the Cold War and Space Race intensified and concerns about the technology gap between the U.S. and the Soviet Union grew more pervasive throughout the 1950s and 1960s, MIT's involvement in the military-industrial complex was a source of pride on campus.[citation needed] <a href="answers/MITsDepartmentofNuclearEngineering.html">MIT's Department of Nuclear Engineering</a> as well as the Center for International Studies were established in 1957.</p><p> <a href="answers/WalkersCourseIXonGeneralStudies.html">Walker's Course IX on General Studies</a> was dissolved shortly after his death and a seventy-year debate followed over what was the appropriate role and scope of humanistic and social studies at MIT.  A new Department of Economics, Statistics, and Political Science was established in 1903 to replace Course IX, which was later split into a Department of Economics and Statistics and a Department of History of Political Science in 1907.  <a href="answers/KarlTaylorCompton.html">Karl Taylor Compton</a> reorganized the Institute to incorporate a Division of Humanities under which these departments were placed in 1932, but could offer no degrees. Between 1918 and 1956, political science classes and faculty were subsumed or merged into any of History and English or Economics and Social Science until a separate Ph.D. program was approved in 1958.  A PhD program in Economics was launched in 1941.</p><p> The 1949 report of the Committee on Educational Survey recommended the establishment of a School of Humanities granting degrees which led to the establishment of the same in 1950 and separate departments in Economics and Political Science were formally established in 1965. Since 1975, all MIT undergraduate students have been required to take eight classes distributed across the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences before receiving their degrees.</p></div></div>
<div style="margin-top: 2em;">
<h4><a href=page05.html>Social movements and activism (1966–1980)</a></h4><div><p> MIT has been nominally coeducational since admitting <a href="answers/EllenSwallowRichards.html">Ellen Swallow Richards</a> in 1870. Female students, however, remained a tiny minority (numbered in dozens) prior to the completion of the first women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1964. Women constituted 43% of the undergraduates and 29% of the graduate students enrolled in 2005.  Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in environmental health.[citation needed]</p><p> However, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, intense protests by student and faculty activists against military-related research required that the MIT administration spin these laboratories off into what would become the <a href="answers/CharlesStarkDraperLaboratory.html">Charles Stark Draper Laboratory</a> and <a href="answers/LincolnLaboratory.html">Lincoln Laboratory</a>. The extent of these protests is reflected by the fact that MIT had more names on "President Nixon's enemies list" than any other single organization, among them its president Jerome Wiesner and professor Noam Chomsky. Memos revealed during Watergate indicated that Nixon had ordered MIT's federal subsidy cut "in view of Wiesner's anti-defense bias." </p><p> MIT's particular strain of anti-authoritarianism has manifested itself in other forms. In 1977, two female students, juniors Susan Gilbert and Roxanne Ritchie, were disciplined for publishing an article on April 28 of that year in the "alternative" MIT campus weekly Thursday. Entitled "<a href="answers/ConsumerGuidetoMITMen.html">Consumer Guide to MIT Men</a>," the article was a sex survey of 36 men the two claimed to have had sex with, and the men were rated according to their performance. Gilbert and Ritchie had intended to turn the tables on the rating systems and facebooks men use for women, but their article led not only to disciplinary action against them but also to a protest petition signed by 200 students, as well as condemnation by President Jerome B. Wiesner, who published a fierce criticism of the article.  Another minor campus uproar occurred when the traditional pornographic registration-day movie was replaced by Star Wars in 1984. </p><p> In 1970, the <a href="answers/thenDeanofInstituteRelationsBensonRSnyder.html">then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder</a>, published The Hidden Curriculum, in which he argued that a mass of unstated assumptions and requirements dominated MIT students' lives and inhibited their ability to function creatively. Snyder contended that these unwritten regulations, like the implicit curricula of informally compiled "course bibles" (problem sets and solutions from previous years' classes), often outweighed the effect of the "formal curriculum," and that the situation was not unique to MIT. After studying the behavior of MIT and Wellesley students, Snyder observed that "bibles" were often in fact counterproductive; they fooled professors into believing that their classes were imparting broad knowledge as intended, but instead locked professors and students into a feedback cycle to the detriment of actual education.</p></div></div>
<div style="margin-top: 2em;">
<h4><a href=page06.html>Changing roles and priorities (1980–2004)</a></h4><div><p> In 1986, <a href="answers/DavidBaltimoreaNobelLaureate.html">David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate</a>, and his colleague, Thereza Imanishi-Kari, were accused of research misconduct. The ensuing controversy involved a Congressional investigation and required him to resign from his new appointment as president of Rockefeller University although the allegations against Imanishi-Kari were dropped and Baltimore eventually became an endowed professor at and president of Caltech.</p><p> Given the scale and reputation of MIT's research accomplishments, allegations of research misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became embroiled in a misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991.   <a href="answers/ProfessorTedPostol.html">Professor Ted Postol</a> has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed.  Dean of Admissions Marilee Jones resigned in April 2007 after she "misrepresented her academic degrees" when she applied to an administrative assistant position in 1979 and never corrected the record despite her subsequent promotions.  </p><p> The Cambridge City Council imposed a city-wide moratorium on research into recombinant DNA in 1976 in response to community concerns that Harvard and MIT researchers may inadvertently release mutant organisms into the ecosystem but the ban was lifted in 1977 after an extensive dialogue between scientists, politicians, and community leaders.   Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international — especially Japanese — firms that were competing with struggling American businesses.    </p><p> <a href="answers/TheJusticeDepartment.html">The Justice Department</a> filed an antitrust suit against MIT and the eight Ivy League colleges in 1991 for holding "Overlap Meetings" to prevent bidding wars over promising students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships. While the Ivy League institutions settled, MIT contested the charges on the grounds that the practice was not anticompetitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students.  MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994.   In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures.  MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. </p></div></div>
