<h4><a href=page03.html>Cambridge campus and interwar years (1916â€“1940)</a></h4><div><p> These attempted mergers occurred in parallel with MITs continued expansion beyond the classroom and laboratory space permitted by its building in Boston. President <a href="answers/RichardMaclaurin.html">Richard Maclaurin</a> sought to move the campus to a new location when he took office in 1909.  An anonymous donor, later revealed to be <a href="answers/GeorgeEastman.html">George Eastman</a>, donated the funds to buy a mile-long tract of swamp and industrial land along the Cambridge side of the Charles River. A distinct new era in MIT's history began when it moved into its new Cambridge campus in 1916. Designed by William Welles Bosworth, who had made a name for himself in designing the AT\&T headquarters in New York City,  the new campus fomented some changes in the stagnating undergraduate curriculum. In the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President Vannevar Bush drastically reformed the curricula by reemphasizing the importance of "pure" sciences like physics and chemistry and reducing the work required in shops and drafting. Despite the difficulties of the <a href="answers/GreatDepression.html">Great Depression</a>, the reforms "renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering."  More fortuitously, they also cemented MIT's academic reputation on the eve of World War II by attracting scientists and researchers who would later make significant contributions in the <a href="answers/RadiationLaboratory.html">Radiation Laboratory</a>, Instrumentation Laboratory, and other defense-related research programs.</p></div></div>
